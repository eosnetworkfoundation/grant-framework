Project Overview
If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful ENF grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.
Overview
Please provide the following:
•	Name: CHALLENGEEOS
•	Brief Description: We provide users with a way to publish and interact with customizable smart contracts through our free-to-download app.
•	Relationship to EOSIO: Our project was initially built on the EOSIO Blockchain and we are one of the pioneer EOSIO projects.
•	Reason for Interest: Our dapp is a tool used to create awareness and is used to onboard new users on the EOSIO Blockchain.
•	Project Details
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
•	Mock-ups/designs of any UI components
•	Data models of the core functionality
•	API specifications of the core functionality
•	An overview of the technology stack to be used Improved Identity Solution, User Support, ‘Go Live’ Feature
•	Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
•	In Milestone 1, We will add needed code to the ChallengeDac code base to reduce fraudulent accounts and provide an increased level of user support for bug issues. Additionally, conduct a full audit of all of the ChallengeDac code so it can be Open-sourced.
•	Improved Identity Solution features to reduce bots and limit users to one account per person. This will improve the results reducing the number of token rewards that are claimed by bots or users operating multiple accounts. Enhanced identity techniques will include IP address tracking, catch verification, and unique user identification.
•	User support features to help identify and track bugs and phone-specific issues and also add troubleshooting
•	ChallengeDac code audit: Fully audit ChallengeDac code complete with new features to release with new features to release publicly to the community.
•	In Milestone 2, Our version 9 will be released with the ‘Go Live’ feature which will consist of a built-in streaming plug-in tool that will allow ChallengeDac users to login to major streaming platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Twitch. 	In the lower bottom corner, streaming users will have their ChallengeDAC username displayed, which will allow users to be sent crypto while live streaming. Wherever Crypto is sent during the live stream a notification will appear on the stream. All current live streamers will have their stream displayed on the ChallengeDac News feed and will be available for ChallengeDac users to vote on, with the most voted on streams appearing highest in the ChallengeDac newsfeed. After the completion of ChallengeDac version 9, the code will be audited and open-sourced to the community.
•	PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
•	What your project is not or will not provide or implement
o	We will not implement the chat feature

Development Status
If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:
•	links to improvement proposals or RFPs (requests for proposal),
•	academic publications relevant to the problem,

•	references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the EOS Network Foundation,
•	previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.
Development Roadmap
This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.
Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We recommend that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.
For each milestone,
Milestone 1: 1 month 
Milestone 2: 2 months and 2 weeks
•	make sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
•	include the amount of funding requested per milestone.
•	Milestone 1: 1 month $39,500
•	Milestone 2: 2 months and 2 weeks $86,500
•	include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
•	provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
•	commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
•	indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
•	Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
⚡ If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.
Milestone Summary
