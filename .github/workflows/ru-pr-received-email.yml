            Hi ${{inputs.contact_name}}, 

            Thank you for your application to the ENF Grant Framework.

            We recieved your ${{inputs.project_name}} application by the ${{inputs.team_name}} team, submitted from the ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.owner.login }} Github account. 

            We are working through our internal processes which includes translating the application followed by a series of meetings.  Thus it may take several weeks to get back to you.
