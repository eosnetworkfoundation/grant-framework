  + Mockups/designs of any UI components
In development: Our platform will support different projects, from EOS SUPPORT to EOS BEES,redirecting users who need more extensive information to different EOS spaces.

+ Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
We are creating a data model on our github: https://github.com/eosvision1

+ An overview of the technology stack to be used
Our project is being created as a simple platform, without much to say, it is free for each user to see information.

+ Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
Developing

+What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
We are NOT building a news platform, we want to teach and we want to spread the news using the tools we have in EOS.


### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOSIO landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  
+ Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
EOS VISION belongs to the growth of the ecosystem.

+ Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our hearing is based on:
Entrepreneurs.
Designers
Journalists
Cryptographic users.

+ What need(s) does your project meet?
A new Marketing opportunity, as well as the opportunity to learn more about EOS, its dApps, ecosystem and development.

+ Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
Yes, there are many training and development centers as well as information centers.

+  - If so, how is your project different?
We propose to offer the information in different languages, as well as to carry out this information daily and in an audiovisual way.

+ If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
We can say that Bywire News is the main information hub for EOS, but we are not looking to compete as we have currently secured a partnership to work together on their platform.

## Team
We have a somewhat young team but they have love and passion for EOS, they have been in the ecosystem for more than two years, most of them are Venezuelans,
who were looking to escape from inflation and the economic crisis and in EOS they found a good way to survive and that your money was safe.

+Our project, although it is new, has been taking shape on its own, with the few funds that were donated by the community in Pomelo, we have worked very hard, from the creation of daily newsletters, to YouTube videos in both Spanish and English.
We have created the main platform of eosvision.news which is in its last stage for SSL verification.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

- **Total Estimated Duration:** The platform will be constantly updated, although aesthetically it is ready. SSL certification is missing. I would say 1 month.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 4
- **Total Costs:** The total costs of platform, tools, workers. is $10,000

## Future Plans

> Please include here
+We want to learn more about DAOS, and give a good experience in EOS VISION when reading an information, as well as encourage users to enjoy being in EOS for more than a price.
We want to fully engage with the entire community as well as help the community grow in Spanish and other languages. We are open to support all projects. We are preparing to create a unique, community-driven study platform.

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

+how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
With existing tools in EOS. We have decided to use the EOS COMMUNITY FORUM blog to keep the daily news that everyone deserves to read, it is a very important page.
As well as the use of existing social networks.

+ the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.
Our team is strong, each one wants to train in EOS and in the future contribute more to the project, soon they will be joining Eden On EOS.

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** EOS Network Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

+**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**
I found out about the Grants Program thanks to a question from a user on Pomelo, so I decided to ask Yves de la Rose who was very kind to me.

> Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- Work you have already done.
- If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
- Previous grants you may have applied for.

+ Work you have already done.
Every day we are showing information on twitter for all users.

+ Previous grants you may have applied for.
We have our proposal in Pomelo where we have had more than 50 Contributors.
Just as in a few days we have obtained some associations.

Important note: if it looks weird, I hope you know that I've never used GitHub and have done it myself. Like everything, I learn fast. I hope you take my project into account... Thank you very much for the opportunity.
