## Project Overview

### Overview


- **Name:** Genki
- **Brief Description:** Genki is a content creation engagement proposal. At Genki we will share some tips to help you engage with Antelope and its chains. Due to the lack of creators and multiple non-used content tools, this is the best time to focus on doing what we do best. Create unique content, attract an audience and build a community.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We provide information and create content for Antelope, formerly EOSIO. Genki presents tips and guides through stories, ideas and resources to the Antelope community and users. Genki has a user base and will expand within the EOSIO and Antelope communities.
- **Reason for Interest:** It is important that exists content to redirect users, and we believe that content creation is the future for promoting services that deeply align the interests of users, the community and its readers. This drives our interest and engagement to content creation for Antelope. Content creation is necessary because of the impact it has on users.

### Project Details


The content published on Genki is created and managed by [Thian](https://twitter.com/thianisoneos), a user of the Antelope community. He has created and promoted content for EOS Bees using publishing tools from bywire.news, DefiBox and other EOS projects.
- An overview of the technology stack to be used

Ghost: We use Ghost as our CMS (content management system) and CDA (Content Delivery Application). Ghost allows us to deploy, store, publish and manage our content. Ghost It also allows the integration of other technologies such as Google Analytics, Netlify as custom integration we need.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

Creation and publication of content as guides, articles and information for Antelope and its networks. These resources are focused on the community, new users and advanced users. We will promote the content in the Antelope communities and social networks through official Genki spaces.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

Content creation is original and managed by a community user (myself). We will not promote information from other sources or medias, all content published and distributed by Genki will be 100% original.
All that we create is published as public and Open Source.

### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Genki fits into the ecosystem growth, community and Art and media.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Genki user base and antelope community.
- What need(s) does your project meet?

 To the critical point of the lack of creators for Antelope.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

Bywire, a news media which uses its own infrastructure and an AI that brings trust and accountability to the news.
