## Project Overview


### Overview


- **Name:** Msig.app - simplify multisig for novice and expert
- **Brief Description:** It is too complicated for a novice to manage multi signatures. We will solve this! And for experts - we have templates that make your daily multisig transactions easy. Save your time for more important things! Blockchain gives us a new sense of personal ownership. Now we also move into group ownership, DAO, cooperation, making decisions together with somebody, etc. We are developing MSIG app (https://msig.app/jungle), which helps both new and pro users to manage multi-signature transactions.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** It uses EOSIO system contracts. It is intended for daily usage by each EOSIO user who needs multi signatures, and this number of users is growing because of DAO and other collective-usage use cases.
- **Reason for Interest:** We are well-known experts in msig topic, creating dozens of complex msigs including starting a few EOSIO blockchains and the famous Jungle. So we saw the intersection of our expertise and the user's needs. In addition, we partnered with a great user-experience expert to make it look nice and simple to use.

### Project Details


Part of the work is already done. Please have a look at this screencast of the UX and you will be able to see our UI components and UX - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSUQGZhlpXDpeuYwc51OyMBK_0Edrn35/view?usp=sharing
You can also view the same on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLrGSM_VvcY

We use React for FrontEnd, it will be a web application at msig.app domain.
We have more Documentation and can provide it on demand.
What your project is_not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is an open question. We have a clear definition of what will be included in the 1st version of our app. But as for the next versions, it is not clear yet, because we also have feedback gathering and R&D phases in our roadmap (details below), so we will decide what else we include in this project later.

### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
Can be used for several use cases: 
1. For anybody, including novice users, who need to create msig transactions.
2. For experts that want to simplify their daily msig operations. We have templates.
3. We can predict some DAO-related cooperations, we already have an interest from DAO tools.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Potentially any EOSIO user who need msig transaction, and this number is groving because of DAO and other collective-usage use cases.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Novice users need a simple tool to create their 1st msig, it is too complicated without our msig.app.
Experts need some tool to simplify their day-to-day msig operations, e.g. payments ect. We have templates for them
Even Experts have a hard time creating different complex msigs, our templates help them also.
DAO tools may use us in the future.
Our app makes EOSIO look more user-friendly, nice-looking interface, and also more professional for new users.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
We do not know about similar projects in EOSIO ecosystem released yet. Users may use bloks.io for msigs or directly call smart contracts in a command-line style, etc. We've not done competitor analysis regarding other chains, but our partner user-experience designer has huge experience in related topics and probably did some analysis, we can continue this analysis in the next phases also.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1

- **Estimated duration:** 1.5 month
- **FTE:**  3.5
- **Costs:** 50,000 USD

We suggest that we do not deliver 0a-0e deliverables because we are not open-source and because delivering it will x3 the cost for us.

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | One of these, for open-source module: MIT / Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can use our open-source module. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | If necessary, the core functions will be covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. |
| 0d. | Docker | If necessary, we will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. But it may be not necessary because our open-source module is in the npmjs |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | The open-source npmjs module (and code) | This can be reused by anybody to create similar projects. The calls from UI to the system smart-contracts will be wrapped there. |  
| 2. | Released web application on www.msig.app | User can create, save (for future reuse), and export msigs in a step-by-step user-friendly manner for the next 7 tx types (templates): Custom Transaction; Transfer Token; Deploy Contract; Change Permissions; Vote for a BP; Buy / Sell RAM; Delegate CPU / NET  |  

## Future Plans

We plan to maintain the app and gather feedback from users and then later maybe add new features based on that feedback and also based on our RnD and expertise. Also, we plan to promote the app through Twitter and through our communities. And also do some level of user support as we do for the rest of our projects (e.g. kolobok.io).
