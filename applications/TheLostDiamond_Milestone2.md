### Overview

- **Name:** The Lost Diamond Adventure Race.
- **Brief Description:** The Lost Diamond is a real-world treasure hunt game where the goal is to find The Lost Diamond by conquering checkpoint NFTs all around the world. A fun, exciting and easy-to-understand GameFi project to let people outside the crypto space discover and learn about EOS, Web3 and NFTs.

- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** 
The EOS Mainnet is the only financial platform available that has the requirements needed to make The Lost Diamond Adventure Race work:
  - Send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds with no fees.
  - With a VISA-card from Coinbase, users can spend that money in their local store just a few minutes later.
  - User friendly tools (e.g. Anchor, Port, Bloks.io)

- **Reason for Interest:** 
  Our team has been involved in EOS since 2018 and we want to contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

  The problem: The EOS blockchain does not have a good YouTube-presence. EOS needs to reach out to more people - especially outside the crypto space to be successful. 

  The EOS blockchain is maybe the first financial platform in the world - that is able to send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds with no fees.
  That message needs to be delivered. With entertaining use-cases that people outside the crypto space understand.
  The Lost Diamond is custom made to do that.

### Project Details

Our team has an ambitious goal to be one of the first projects to achieve mass adoption on a Web3-platform. 
To build one of the most popular social platforms for outdoor activities, with millions of monthly active users.

150 million people are hunting virtual monsters on PokémonGo. 150 million people subscribe to YouTuber MrBeast's entertaining challenges where 
money is given back to the show's participants. By utilizing the EOS, we can do this better. We have the opportunity and advantage to replace
virtual monsters with real money. And publish entertaining challenges on YouTube where money can be sent to participants all over the world
in less than three seconds.

For people to adapt a new technology in mass, it needs to improve their lives by an order of magnitude. 
It’s not an easy task to motivate non-tech people to create an EOS-account, download and learn how to use Anchor sign-in or create a Coinbase account. It’s a steep learning curve. TheLostDiamond solves this by having a $1,000 dollar lost diamond as incentive for participating. 

The Lost Diamond is free to use for everyone. Everyone can conquer one checkpoint per day in the free tier.
A premium paid tier is available, where participants pay a $7 dollar monthly fee to conquer unlimited checkpoints per day. 

The smart contract returns 80% back to the Play2Earn model to fund the lost diamonds. A true Web3 application where everyone can
create, own and monetize their content.

We are aiming for 1M+ users (0.65% market share from PokémonGo, 0.65% market share from YouTuber MrBeast) within four years.

TheLostDiamond will be self-sustaining at 5,000 active users per month. 

Until we reach a self-sustaining level, we need to fund the $1,000 dollar lost diamonds from sponsors, grants,
investors and/or entry fees from other single-event races. 

The value of The Lost Diamond is now $1,000 dollars (funded by the ENF GF grant i Milestone 1). The Lost Diamond
treasure hunt is online. If you sign in with Anchor - and if you find The Lost Diamond, you and the Checkpoint NFT creator will
both get $1,000 dollars - instantly paid out to your EOS-account. And if you have a VISA-card from Coinbase, you can spend
that money in your local store just minutes later.

What is the definition of a user: 
  - A user that conquers, creates or gets rewarded when a NFT Checkpoint challenge is solved.   

What is the current user baseline:
  - 17 users (https://cptblackbill.com/start Scoreboard April 2023).

What is the definition of a follower:
  - A YouTube subscriber on The Lost Diamond Adventure Race YouTube-channel.   

What is the current follower baseline:
  - 58 YouTube-subscribers. (https://www.youtube.com/@thelostdiamondrace)

What is the Objective Key Result for The Lost Diamond project: 
- Objective: To build The Lost Diamond to be a successful YouTube-GameFi-show and the most exciting treasure hunt everyone will love. As a channel
to promote the awesome capabilities the EOS blockchain has - to people that are outside the crypto space.

Key Results:
- 22% monthly growth in YouTube subscribers.
- 22% monthly growth in organic views.
- 22% monthly active users growth in TheLostDiamond $7 dollar subscription fee.

What is the explicit target number of followers, users and transactions given the baseline:
- 1M+ YouTube-subscribers
- 1M+ monthly active users
- We are ranking in the top five on EOS Dapp-radar.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - The main goal of TheLostDiamond project is ecosystem growth.

- Who is your target audience?
  - People outside the crypto space. From our YouTube channel analytics: Male(57%) Female(43%) Age: 18-44(70%) 44+(20%) 

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - For the eos-ecosystem: A project that has the potential to get mass adoption and 1M+ monthly active users.
  - For users: Entertainment. The most exciting global treasure hunt everyone loves.

## Development Status

Video-presentation from Milestone 1, improvements, developement status: https://youtu.be/GUlSCTZtXZc

We have a working MVP that has been used for testing the application in several single-event races in Norway and for testing The Lost Diamond global adventure race during the Milestone 1 period. 

The smart contract is located on the EOS-Mainnet account cptblackbill. The code is available at https://github.com/bjornomsland/CaptainBlackBillSmartContract

The MVP frontend is a website developed in NodeJs and hosted on Google Clouds. Users need to install the Anchor app to sign in. 

We need (and are working to get funding for) The Lost Diamond app on Google Play and App Store. To improve the user experience.

The goal for Milestone 1 was to prove that The Lost Diamond MVP could onboard participants that paid a $7 dollar monthly subscription fee and obtain a 22% monthly growth rate over two months. That was not possible to achieve on The Lost Diamond version 2022. A major reconstruction and several improvements were needed.
Execution of deliverables in Milestone 1 was therefore postponed to February 2023 and was consider accomplished by our team April 30th.   

As conclusion from Milestone 1: 
- The Lost Diamond MVP is not a good user-experience. 50 unique people have started the step for sign-in-with-anchor, but aborted when it gets too complicated. The Lost Diamond needs to deliver a high-quality user experience to be successful.
- We need more work and focus on creating YouTube-videos with great stories around the hunt for the lost diamond and how the EOS blockchain makes it possible to send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds, to onboard users. 

The most important improvements that has been added during the Milestone 1 period and Pomelo season 4 and 5:  

- A free-tier. It is now free to conquer one checkpoint per day.
- Added additional gems and surprises in addition to The Lost Diamond, to make the game more interesting.
- Lowering the level of finding the lost diamond - now, when a user has conquered ten checkpoints, the location of The Lost Diamond will be revealed to that user.
- A checkpoint caretaker - as a - YouTube-game-host character is added to the game. To explain what it’s all about and to be a kind and generous competitor for other players hunting the lost diamond.
- Some low level checkpoints like secret codes on statues, can be solved without getting outdoors. (That creates more engagement from users all over the world)
- Added a reward to the user who knows the location of the lost diamond first. So if a person knows where the diamond is, but is too far away to get it, that user will get 10% of the diamond’s value when the diamond is conquered by someone else.
- A stable connection to EOS endpoints has been a repeating problem. Causing an error when users are conquering a checkpoint. That has been solved by having an internal pool of endpoints, that is continuously checked for connection time and connection errors.

The Lost Diamond business model was updated in 2023. The old business model had only one source of income; users that pay a $7 dollar monthly subscription.
The new business model has five income sources and a free tier to make The Lost Diamond easily available for everyone.
- A free tier
- Participants paying a $7 dollar monthly subscription
- Sponsorships on YouTube-videos
- YouTube Monetization
- Racing fees from public events
- Selling merch - like books/treasure maps/travel-guides to our fan-base.
