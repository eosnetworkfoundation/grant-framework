## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Monezo
- **Brief Description:** Monezo is a revolutionary platform that connects traditional real world assets & businesses revenue with NFT holders.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Monezo is a revolutionary platform that connects traditional real world assets & businesses revenue with NFT holders. We are building an ecosystem which will bring a new users in crypto and NFT as well as aggregate experienced users because of unique experience and opportunities provided by our core product Yieldful NFT. We belive that Monezo in collaboration with EOS will be able to increase amount of users, transactions and use cases in both EOS and Monezo ecosystems. Appling for a grant our main priority is to find advisors and partners who can share relavant experience. 
- **Reason for Interest:** We have two main verticals. The first one is Yeldful NFT - our core product, which will support all major multichains (ETH; FLOW; APT; POLYGON; BNB chains). The second vertical is a MONK native token which will be built on a FLOW blockchain. It connects all Monezo ecosystem products together.

### Project Details

Monezo is striving to solve  the current market issue which is related to the lack of stable & safe investment opportunities which can offer considerable return of funds in order to handle the hyperinflation rate, degree of risk, and volatility presented in the crypto market.
Therefore, Monezo provides stable, crypto market neutral, high-yield investment opportunities for NFT investors.

What do we solve: 
Lack of flexibility in the preferred amount
of capital investments; 
Lack of all-in-one platforms that connects
NFT investors and traditional assets &
business owners;
High intermediate fees & expenses charged by management companies;
Lack of tracking tools for real-time yield farming for various asset types;
Lack of investment opportunities independent from the crypto market conditions & volatility (bear market);
High entry-barrier for traditional assets & businesses. Tax and regulatory compliance;

### Ecosystem Fit

As Monezo is a revolutionary platform we belive that we will bring a totally new crypto experience for the crypto industry. Beside that, we belive that due to our multichain NFT collections and MONK native token built on FLOW we will be able to bring from other chains and aggregate new users and their resources to ENF ecosystem. Monezo mission is to build customer-centric, all-in-one platform, where investors & businesses are connected in Monezo ecosystem to benefit from finance. We aim to serve not only crypto investors, but also to people not familiar with crypto yet, it brings much bigger market base.
