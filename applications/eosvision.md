We have created the main platform of eosvision.news which is in its last stage for SSL verification.

We want to fully engage with the entire community as well as help the community grow in Spanish and other languages. We are open to support all projects. We are preparing to create a unique, community-driven study platform.

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

With existing tools in EOS. We have decided to use the EOS COMMUNITY FORUM blog to keep the daily news that everyone deserves to read, it is a very important page.
As well as the use of existing social networks.

Our team is strong, each one wants to train in EOS and in the future contribute more to the project, soon they will be joining Eden On EOS.

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**
I found out about the Grants Program thanks to a question from a user on Pomelo, so I decided to ask Yves de la Rose who was very kind to me.


- Work you have already done.

Every day we are showing information on twitter for all users.

- Previous grants you may have applied for.

We have our proposal in Pomelo where we have had more than 50 Contributors.
Just as in a few days we have obtained some associations.
