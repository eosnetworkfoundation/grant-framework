## Project Overview

This grant will fund the integration of TrustEVM and the customization of the Balancer protocol into the Fundle application. This functionality will allow users to buy/sell tokens per community according to a token bonding curve mechanism. 
  
### Overview

- **Name:** Fundle
- **Brief Description:** 

Fundle is a platform where businesses can build tokenized communities to increase customer engagement! We allow businesses to build strong long-term relationships, offer new customer experiences and gain more out of a community.

Each business has its own token to build a community and digital economy. Holders of that token (members) can unlock specific rewards, experiences, or involvement. Every community is unique since it has different types of rewards or involvements.

For a detailed explanation please visit: https://wefundle.com/ and https://wefundle.com/about

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We are planning to run the token bonding curve mechanism and AMM on TrustEVM!
- **Reason for Interest:** Blockchain allows us to revolutionize and strengthen the position of the community. We truly believe in the added value of Antelope, so we would like to utilize the benefits of high throughput and low transaction costs for our users. With the entrance of the ENF, we see that many good developments are going on, and therefore we have trust in Antelope for the future!

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Our platform will run on the Antelope blockchain and so Antelope ecosystem, this brings lots of new users (also non/new crypto users) who will interact and get to know the Antelope blockchain. So our dApp will be build on the TrustEVM and so Antelope network. Fundle shows others what possibilities Antelope has and that it is possible to build these platforms on the Antelope blockchain! We can be an use case for TrustEVM. In the next phases we will extend and build the system further out. For example a democratic fundraising mechanism, these protocols will fit into the Antelope ecosystem! 

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our focus is on innovative and creative businesses with existing communities who like to have more interaction with their fanbase or startups who want to build a community. On the other side we have members, we are targetting also on members who have never used blockchain before (therefore payment accesibility with fiat on ramps is important for us). The systems is going to be easy understandable and customer friendly. In our future plans when people can work for communities we will also be targetting creatives/freelancers. So, it is a platform that is useful and interesting for a wide range of people.


- What need(s) does your project meet?

#### For members:
Current community building and crowdfunding platforms lack real community involvement. Members cannot really be "part of" and there is little interaction. Furthermore, both business and members cannot always have fair benefits (social and/or economical).

Therefore, Fundle offers:
- Exclusive membership with access to special perks, experiences, and more community benefits. Members are proud token holders of the community.
- Involvement and interaction with the business. Members won't simply support the business financially but can be involved in the design process for example.
- More members entering the community can lead to an increase in personal token value.
- Creatives can work for the community in exchange for community tokens. For example, website or logo design, (social media) marketing, video or picture creation/editing, etc.
- Democratic fundraising mechanism in which members have control over the collected money. (Mechanism will be included in the future)

#### For businesses:
From business perspective, much more can be gained from a community (skills, opinions, etc.). An involved and active community will result in happy, returning customers that increase brand awareness and trust. This will positively affect the profit and success of the business.

Therefore, Fundle offers:
- Stronger and intenser community building thanks to the community token model. 
  - Incentivize members to engage and promote the business more than ever because members have economic & social incentives to help the business succeed.
  - Stimulates members to participate and think actively.
- Access to the skills of a whole community to help grow and improve the business.
  - The system enables to unlock new forms of product creation and working, namely together with members.
- Building of a digital economy. The market cap of the tokens gives a good representation of the value that the community is worth. Community will grow not only by its members but also in value.
- Flexible funding with multiple funding rounds and direct access to part of the funds. (Mechanism will be included in the future)

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
To the best of our knowledge there are no similar projects in the Antelope or related ecosystems, there is only rally and deso who are applying a token bonding curve mechanism for community building of influencers.

## Development Status

The application (non blockchain part) is tested right now with users on usability and bugs. It shows exactly how the first phase of the platform will work and look like. The blockchain integration is the last part to finish the application. 

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

### Milestone Summary

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 250,000 USD

The plan is to use this grant for the last phase of our development before we can launch. Namely the token bonding curve mechanism. We will use, customize and integrate the open source Balancer protocol. With this budget Fundle can finish the platform (blockchain + security), create brand awareness, build the team, launch the platform and further develop/improve features.


### Milestone 1 - Balancer protocol customization

The protocol will allow users to buy/sell tokens per community according to a token bonding curve mechanism. So each community has its own token which is created when business create their community on Fundle. For the first step we will use USDT as the reserve token. Per community USDT will be bonded to the community token. When users send USDT, the community token will be mint according to the current price and supply and when users want to sell their tokens the tokens are burned according to the current price and supply.
