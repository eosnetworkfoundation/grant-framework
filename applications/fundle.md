## Project Overview

This grant will fund the integration of TrustEVM and the customization of the Balancer protocol into the Fundle application. This functionality will allow users to buy/sell tokens per community according to a token bonding curve mechanism. 
  
### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** Fundle
- **Brief Description:** 

Fundle is a platform where businesses can build tokenized communities to increase customer engagement! We allow businesses to build strong long-term relationships, offer new customer experiences and gain more out of a community.

Each business has its own token to build a community and digital economy. Holders of that token (members) can unlock specific rewards, experiences, or involvement. Every community is unique since it has different types of rewards or involvements.

For a detailed explanation please visit: https://wefundle.com/ and https://wefundle.com/about

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We are planning to run the token bonding curve mechanism and AMM on the TrustEVM blockchain!
- **Reason for Interest:** Blockchain allows us to revolutionize and strengthen the position of the community. We truly believe in the added value of Antelope, so we would like to utilize the benefits of high throughput and low transaction costs for our users. With the entrance of the ENF, we see that many good developments are going on, and therefore we have trust in Antelope for the future!


### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components
- Data models of the core functionality
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOSIO landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Our platform will run on the Antelope blockchain and so Antelope ecosystem, this brings lots of new users (also non/new crypto users) who will interact and get to know the Antelope blockchain. So our dApp will be build on the TrustEVM and so Antelope network. Fundle shows others what possibilities Antelope has and that it is possible to build these platforms on the Antelope blockchain! In the next phases we will extend and build further. For example a democratic fundraising mechanism, these protocols will fit into the Antelope ecosystem!

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our focus is on innovative and creative businesses with existing communities who like to have more interaction with their fanbase or startups who want to build a community. On the other site we have members, we are targetting also on members who have never used blockchain before (therefore payment accesibility with fiat on ramps is important for us). The systems needs to be easy understandable and customer friendly. In our future plans when people can work for communities we will also be targetting creatives/freelancers. So, it is a platform that is useful and interesting for a wide range of people.


- What need(s) does your project meet?

#### For members:
Current community building and crowdfunding platforms lack real community involvement. Members cannot really be "part of" and there is little interaction. Furthermore, both business and members cannot always have fair benefits (social and/or economical).

Therefore, Fundle offers:
- Exclusive membership with access to special perks, experiences, and more community benefits. Members are proud token holders of the community.
- Involvement and interaction with the business. Members won't simply support the business financially but can be involved in the design process for example.
- More members entering the community can lead to an increase in personal token value.
- Creatives can work for the community in exchange for community tokens. For example, website or logo design, (social media) marketing, video or picture creation/editing, etc.
- Democratic fundraising mechanism in which members have control over the collected money. (Mechanism will be included in the future)

#### For businesses:
From business perspective, much more can be gained from a community (skills, opinions, etc.). An involved and active community will result in happy, returning customers that increase brand awareness and trust. This will positively affect the profit and success of the business.

Therefore, Fundle offers:
- Stronger and intenser community building thanks to the community token model. 
  - Incentivize members to engage and promote the business more than ever because members have economic & social incentives to help the business succeed.
  - Stimulates members to participate and think actively.
- Access to the skills of a whole community to help grow and improve the business.
  - The system enables to unlock new forms of product creation and working, namely together with members.
- Building of a digital economy. The market cap of the tokens gives a good representation of the value that the community is worth. Community will grow not only by its members but also in value.
- Flexible funding with multiple funding rounds and direct access to part of the funds. (Mechanism will be included in the future)


__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
To the best of our knowledge there are no similar projects in the Antelope or related ecosystems, there is only rally and deso who are applying a token bonding curve mechanism for community building of influencers.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Milestone Summary

> Note: the numbers in the three lines below are examples.  Please replace with your own calculations!  Then delete this instruction line.
> You **must** keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved.  The Total Cost should add up to the costs
> of all of your Milestones.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 12,000 USD

> Please note that this application is automatically parsed.<br/>
> For the above fields, please only put the answer on that line.  If you want to add more information, please put it below these instructions.<br/>
> Please remember to delete all lines that start with `>` as they are just instructions and not needed in the application submission.<br/>
> 
> Notes on above fields:
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement EOSIO Application

| 0a. | License | MIT / Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our EOSIO nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)

| 3. | Caching layer | We will create a caching layer ... |  
| 4. | API interface to our app | We will create an API that ... |  


The plan is to use this grant for the last phase of our development before we can launch. Namely the token bonding curve mechanism. We will use, customize and integrate the open source Balancer protocol. 

### Milestone 1 - Balancer Protocol integration

The protocol will allow users to buy/sell tokens per community according to a token bonding curve mechanism. So each community has its own token which is created when business create their community on Fundle. For the first step we will use USDT as the reserve token. Per community USDT will be bonded to the community token. When users send USDT, the community token will be mint according to the current price and supply and when users want to sell their tokens the tokens are burned according to the current price and supply.

## Future Plans

> Please include here:

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

We see many expansion options for the Fundle platform and we will stay commited to it. We really believe in full tokenization and digital economies. In the coming years we will slowly move towards the adoption of digital economies.
