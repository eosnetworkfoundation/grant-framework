## Project Overview
Estate attorneys and members of the judicial system will be able to use decentralized ledger technology to authenticate Last Will and Testaments, and associated documents, as the ones executed by a decedent. 
All associated records, videos, and letters will serve as reliable, authentic, and secure records of one’s last wishes inside an NFT and multi-sig wallet.
In addition to making wills less susceptible to tampering, this project also points to multiple other uses for decentralized ledger technology in the legal profession, including the authentication of a chain of ownership, validation of contracts, record-keeping, storage, security, and controlled access.
This will make sure that people's final wishes are properly recorded and can't be changed by anyone. It will also serve as a forever legacy for future generations.


### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** Legacy Ledger - Allowing any Estate Attorney to help keep more families out of probate by storing thier trust/will information on chain.
- **Brief Description:** A brief description of your project.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** We used EOS quite a bit a few years ago.  We helped FedEx review the chain for a project they were considering. We have entered two teams into the SanFran hackathon and both teams ended up getting prizes. 

- **Reason for Interest:** We left due to the conflict internally. We love how fast and easy EOS is on the technology side. We are coming back due to Lliam Buckley explaining all the new things happening. 

### Project Details

The main goal is to create the first Legacy Ledger for validating wills and securely preserving and providing sentimental items to beneficiaries. This Legacy Ledger will serve as a historical record and may have a public section for sharing items like a time capsule.
The Legacy Ledger has the potential to radically alter the way people have executed wills for centuries.It will be harnessed to create a distributed ledger of wills that would maintain a reliable record of a testator’s desires for the post-mortem distribution of estate assets. The Legacy Ledger can serve the true purpose of wills formalities—which is to authenticate a document as the one executed by the testator with the intention of having it serve as the binding directive for the distribution of property. By uniting web3 technology with the innovations of the best aspects of electronic wills legislation, the Legacy Ledger will serve as a reliable, authentic, and secure record of a decedent’s last wishes for disposition of property.
As financial institutions and governments have moved to develop web3 solutions for the delivery of services, lawyers have lagged behind. In some legal circles, attorneys have become interested in “smart contracts” and the possibility of using blockchain to create a more accurate record of real property deeds. But most lawyers have not yet invested the requisite time and energy needed to understand how decentralized ledger technology works and to develop systems that would use the technology effectively. By demonstrating how the Legacy Ledger will make wills less susceptible to tampering, once created, this project also points to multiple other uses for decentralized ledger technology in the legal profession, including authentication of chain of ownership, record-keeping, and contracts.
Even though lawyers have been slow to harness blockchain/DLT’s potential, the technology holds the promise to transform the practice of law into a form that will be unrecognizable to today’s lawyer.


### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? This fits in the web2 meets web3 ecosystem.  Allowing wallets, NFTs and onchain data to be integrated into the legal software for last wills and testiments.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? The targetted audience will be Estate Attorneys and allowing them to bring their own clientell. 
- What need(s) does your project meet? This is a basic but growth project creating wallet users and onchain transactions
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem? Not that we know of
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
