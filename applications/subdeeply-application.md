## Project Overview

### Overview

We had already submitted an application that was rejected by the ENF Grants Committee and during the last few months after the rejection, we have taken a turn in the direction of the product. As we have been made aware in the comments of the previous application.

We submitted the application clearer. As well as being clearer about what we are going to do and how we are will achieve it.

- **Name:** Subdeeply Platform
- **Brief Description:** Subdeeply is a decentralized educational service/platform that will allow the community and
users to access information, guides, podcast episodes and resources on each of the
EOSIO based chains including, EOS, TLOS, WAX and UX.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We are integrated into EOSIO as a service and a tool for accessing information resources on the different chains based on EOSIO.
- **Reason for Interest:** Subdeeply is focused on increasing the adoption of new and potential users towards EOSIO based blockchains, the adoption and use of their services, our goal is to create a platform to support users in identifying the different services and use cases, implement and provide information about the blockchains with the objective that users get involved in the blockchains and their technology, learn about the different services they offer, learn how to use them and subsequently boost the blockchain ecosystem through more active users.

- Relevant prior work or research on the topic

Subdeeply is a scalable project, and may become profitable in the future. There is nothing similar to Subdeeply, the only direct competition would be the conventional media, but they only publish information related to news, not education. Subdeeply is not intended to be a conventional media, the goal is to apply blockchain technology to education, and apply decentralized education as a framework towards the Web3 future. Blockchain education is still in its early stages

### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The project fits into global communities, investors and users by offering users access to information media and educational resources allowing users to identify the different types of uses and services of EOSIO-based networks.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Investors, communities, developers, gamers and all communities.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? None, not even a similar one with the same focus and objectives.
  - If so, how is your project different?

Blockchain education is still in its early stages, there are no services or platform like Saubdeeply. As a general idea, it is good to have educational hubs, and subdeeply aims to provide the gateway to impact blockchain education, and drive adoption in EOSIO-based blockchains.
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Future Plans

Subdeeply aims to build a platform that helps drive blockchain education towards web3, offering a service for global communities and integrating tools for users to identify and learn about the uses and services of EOSIO based blockchains.

We focus on creating a platform that drives the adoption of services in EOSIO blockchain ecosystems such as EOS, WAX, Telos, UX. Attract investors and potential users. In the short term we will prioritize the development of the platform so that it does not present any kind of difficulties and affect the user experience on the platform.

In the longer term, we will implement a business model based on advertising or premium features, some of these features include subscriptions or plans, or a native ecosystem itself. These market strategies are sustainable, we believe that blockchain education is continuously evolving and in the future there will be more services like subdeeply, we want to incorporate features to support the adoption of eosio based blockchain ecosystems.
