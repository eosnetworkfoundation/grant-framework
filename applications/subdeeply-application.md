## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Subdeeply Platform
- **Brief Description:** Subdeeply is a decentralized educational service/platform that will allow the community and
users to access information, guides, podcast episodes and resources on each of the
EOSIO based chains including, EOS, TLOS, WAX and UX.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We are integrated into EOSIO as a service and a tool for accessing information resources on the different chains based on EOSIO.
- **Reason for Interest:** Subdeeply is focused on increasing the adoption of new and potential users towards EOSIO based blockchains, the adoption and use of their services, our goal is to create a platform to support users in identifying the different services and use cases, implement and provide information about the blockchains with the objective that users get involved in the blockchains and their technology, learn about the different services they offer, learn how to use them and subsequently boost the blockchain ecosystem through more active users.

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Relevant prior work or research on the topic

Subdeeply is a scalable project, and may become profitable in the future. There is nothing similar to Subdeeply, the only direct competition would be the conventional media, but they only publish information related to news, not education. Subdeeply is not intended to be a conventional media, the goal is to apply blockchain technology to education, and apply decentralized education as a framework towards the Web3 future. Blockchain education is still in its early stages

### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The project fits into global communities, investors and users by offering users access to information media and educational resources allowing users to identify the different types of uses and services of EOSIO-based networks.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Investors, communities, developers, gamers and all communities.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? None, not even a similar one with the same focus and objectives.
  - If so, how is your project different?

Blockchain education is still in its early stages, there are no services or platform like Saubdeeply. As a general idea, it is good to have educational hubs, and subdeeply aims to provide the gateway to impact blockchain education, and drive adoption in EOSIO-based blockchains.
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status

Our team designed the web and responsive platform, it can be found in the following figma file:

- https://www.figma.com/file/VyB5mKlQRSJTPHyeoXkrEA/Subdeeply-Web-App?node-id=3901%3A36637

We have started to develop and adapt the platform to a mobile application for iOS and Android users:

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
