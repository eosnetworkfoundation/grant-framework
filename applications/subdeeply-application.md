# EOS Network Foundation Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** EOSIO Learning Dapp & Mobile/Web UI/UX Platform
- **Team Name:** Subdeeply
- **EOS Payment Address:** subdeeplyeos
- **[Level](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework#grant-levels):** 2

## Project Overview
This application is a follow up support to the intial proposal on [Pomelo](https://pomelo.io/grants/subdeeplyla).
The purpose of this document is to provide additional details about Subdeeply's current position and a view of our develompment plan. It assumes the audience has an initial understanding of our project and is intended for public use. Our motivation for this funding is to accelerate the growth behind our tuning project and help make it even better for consumers/users by providing information and educational resources for users to learn more about the operation, development, uses and benefits of the EOSIO ecosystem.

### Overview

- **Name:** EOSIO Learning Dapp & Mobile/Web UI/UX Platform
- **Brief Description:** Whiteboard for the creative process. Creation of educational content in Subdeeply offering information and educational resources, with a Mobile/Web platform based on EOSIO for users to learn, receive information and resources in multi-format and single purpose.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The Mobile/Web application allows any individual or user to learn and manage the resources on EOSIO strings by integrating EOS technology.
- **Reason for Interest:** Subdeeply is a slate for the creative process. While this vision is broad, we believe that our enduring position in creating educational content and information allows us to build toward category ownership. If all visual data exists in Subdeeply, then how we create, collect, collaborate and present this information can also happen in Subdeeply over time. Our goal is for the project to support 100% of the creative process. We will focus on breadth over depth, offering information and educational resources, as well as a platform for users who are willing to learn and receive information through a series of multi-format, single-purpose resources.

### Project Details
#### Analysis

Our project is developed on the basis of four important pillars that allow us to measure our development and growth: platform, growth, engagement and operations. These sections are interrelated, and we approach each of them with a philosophy of testing and inertia.

1. **Platformt:** How are project/product features prioritized?
    
    *Guidance from a project roadmap and a window into the strategic plan that will shape the next 3, 6, and 1 year at Subdeeply.*
    
2. **Growth:** How are users discovering and adopting the product?
    
    *Analysis around our users acquisition and onboarding funnel.*
    
3. **Engagement:** How engaged are users today?
    
    *Metrics that provide a snapshot of user growth in our newsletter.*
    
4. **Operations:** How would additional capital be used?
    
    *Summary of current expenses and operating model for the next 3 months, as well as the latest thinking on upcoming increases.*

#### Additional comments

For now our documentation is in local folders and code, local tests are run on our development machine [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for Web and [AWS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/) for Android/iOS, we run host side tests. We tend to be small and fast, isolating the object to test from the rest of the application. This allows us to reduce operating costs given our low development budget.

We expect giving time to update and upload all our documentation is around 3-4 weeks.

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

Currently, 100% of our users expect to receive informational resources about blockchain, but they do not compare us to these informational products. Our technical category is content marketing ("CM"), an industry where 70% of customers are first-time consumers. Our goal is to quickly acquire leading product growth ahead of any blockchain-based CM from EOSIO.

The following chart highlights our statistics of our user growth in our newsletter. Data through [Substack](http://substack.com)

<img alt="subdeeply-newsletter-subscribers" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94427218/167067197-75d792a4-c824-452b-a6da-cea3091a123d.png">

1. **Acquire:** New users are directed to our social accounts, content marketing ("Drops"), a public dashboard, or a public asset and view the service in use. They move to our website to learn more and start the onboarding flow.
2. **Revenue:** Today, we see expansion happening alongside an existing workflow: content requests. Users using the service have request forms to request specific content. Instead of addressing tickets, we group users. We believe that these new users are "visual communicators" and we are studying their behavior to create new entries to the free service.
3. **Development:** We need to lean into these use cases further with product improvements that would drive a larger percentage of the audience to our site.

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

       - We characterize our project as an educational data collaboration service built for visual workflows.
       - We are not creating a service that users or individuals have to pay a fee to access.
       - We are not a training center, but rather we are creating educational content and resources for users to learn 
         about the operation, development, usecases, benefits or features of multiple EOSIO-based chains.

#### 
### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Through the entire community and potential or new users, offering information and educational resources in multi-format audio, video and reading content to which any user will have free access.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

To any individual or member, to understand our audience we will track various engagement metrics to help us understand the usage and growth of our users.

We will use **retention** to understand the impact of our content on new users and to keep them coming back. We will break it down further to understand what user actions correlate with increased retention.

We will use **stickiness** to understand how often our users use the platform. The stickier we are, the more ingrained we are in our users' workflows and the more likely we are to retain and expand our workspaces.

Finally, we will use **weekly active users** to measure the volume of users we engage and are registered.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

As a multi-format educational resource platform and collaborative information service. We respond to the direct needs of our users, responding to inquiries and comments on what type of educational content or information they want to access.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?

Not at this time the modern creative cloud will prioritize collaboration in the workspace for users around the world. Subdeeply estimates that there are over 500k potential users for Subdeeply's y el ecosistema exponential growth, we offers the firts collaborative educational platform to create content and information of educational resources in multi-format of audio, video. and reading about EOSIO-based blockchains.

- Are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

We have not seen, (nor do we know of) a platform dedicated to educational content for users of such chains, on Ethereum there is a program for cryptocurrencies called "Bankless"; dedicated to sharing crypto & DeFi information.

## Future Plans

In the next 3 months we will consolidate our position as the modern creative cloud. Subdeeply will become a place of information. Each user will enjoy very different experiences depending on their needs and ways of consuming content.

Our goal over the next 12 months is to focus on content creation optimization. We will launch a free service and continue to be opportunistic with existing accounts that want to scale into the project. In early 2022 we will start creating content about EOSIO-based blockchains in drafts before the initial launch and intend to launch a dedicated content and educational resource approach for any user. We are persevering for the long term and will be ahead of the next 6 months with features that will allow us to cannibalize a funnel of potential users.

Developing a fully targeted information collaboration service requires patience and a constant emphasis on micro-improvements. This year, these aspects of the user journey will be refined before we invest anything behind our acquisition funnel.


## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** In the Fireside Chats on the EOS Discord Server, and official ENF media coverage.

As a multi-format educational platform and information collaboration service, Subdeeply has invested in a more technically complex infrastructure of services such as AWS, Adobe Suite, Zendesk, Microsoft Azure and others. That said, this is also a high gross margin service that has low churn and limited manual support. The underlying infrastructure requires ongoing management, but the scope of user-side experiences that can be tailored to this infrastructure is infinite. Subdeeply claims to own the entire creative process; and while this is a significant challenge, it aligns with current and emerging trends of consolidation in tools.

The purpose of this document is to provide additional details about Subdeeply's current position and a view of our growth and development plan. It assumes the audience has an initial understanding of our project and is intended for public use. Our motivation for this fundraiser is to accelerate the growth behind our tuning project and help make it even better for consumers/users by providing information and educational resources for users to learn more about the operation, development, uses and benefits of EOSIO-based blockchains.
