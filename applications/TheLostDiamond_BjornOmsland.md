## Project Overview

This application is in response to an RFP. (Open application process)

### Overview

The Lost Diamond is a real-world P2E treasure hunt where the goal is to find The Lost Diamond by conquering checkpoints all around the world.
A fun, exciting and easy-to-understand GameFi project to let people discover and learn about EOS, Web3 and NFTs.

Please watch this updated pitch: https://youtu.be/GUlSCTZtXZc   
YouTube-channel: https://www.youtube.com/@thelostdiamondrace   
This 90 second intro video will give a good overview: https://youtu.be/3BKr1uY6nZ8

The EOS blockchain is maybe the first financial platform in the world - that is able to send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds with no fees.

That message needs to be delivered! With entertaining use-cases that people outside the crypto space understand!

The Lost Diamond is custom made to do exactly that. With a golden thread in every video:

“_The EOS blockchain can send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds.  And with a VISA-card from Coinbase, you can spend that money in your local store just a few minutes later_.”

Our team has been involved in EOS since 2018 and we want to contribute to the ecosystem's growth and teach people outside the crypto space how blockchain technology can be used in a fun and educational way.


### Project Details

Our team has an ambitious and long term commitment to make TheLostDiamond one of the most popular social platforms for outdoor activities, with millions of monthly active users.

150 million people are hunting virtual monsters on PokémonGo. 150 million people subscribe to YouTuber MrBeast's entertaining challenges where money is given back to the show's participants. By utilizing the EOS, we can do this better. We have the opportunity and advantage to replace virtual monsters with real money. And publish entertaining challenges on YouTube where money can be sent to participants all over the world in less than three seconds.

For people to adapt a new technology in mass, it needs to improve their lives by an order of magnitude. 
It’s not an easy task to motivate non-tech people to create an EOS-account, download and learn how to use Anchor sign-in or create a Coinbase account. It’s a steep learning curve. TheLostDiamond solves this by having a $1,000 dollar lost diamond as incentive for participating. 

The Lost Diamond is free to use for everyone. Everyone can conquer one checkpoint per day in the free tier.
A premium paid tier is available, where participants pay a $7 dollar monthly fee to conquer unlimited checkpoints per day. 

The Lost Diamond business model was updated in 2023. The old business model had only one source of income; users that pay a $7 dollar monthly subscription.
The new business model has five income sources and a free tier to make The Lost Diamond easily available for everyone.
- A free tier
- Participants paying a $7 dollar monthly subscription
- Sponsorships on YouTube-videos
- YouTube Monetization
- Racing fees from public events
- Selling merch - like books/treasure maps/travel-guides to our fan-base.

The smart contract returns 80% back to the Play2Earn model to fund the lost diamonds. A true Web3 application where everyone can create, own and monetize their content.

We are aiming for 1 million users (0.65% market share from PokémonGo) within four years.

TheLostDiamond will be self-sustaining at 5,000 active users per month. 

Until we reach a self-sustaining level, we need to fund the $1,000 dollar lost diamonds from sponsors, grants, investors and/or entry fees from other single-event races. 

The value of The Lost Diamond is now $1,000 dollars (funded by the ENF GF grant i Milestone 1). The Lost Diamond treasure hunt is online. If you sign in with Anchor - and if you find The Lost Diamond, you and the checkpoint creator will both get $1,000 dollars - instantly paid out to your EOS-account. And if you have a VISA-card from Coinbase, you can spend that money in your local store just minutes later.

The goal for Milestone 1 was to prove that The Lost Diamond MVP could onboard participants that paid a $7 dollar monthly subscription fee and obtain a 22% monthly growth rate over two months. That was not possible to achieve on The Lost Diamond version 2022. A major reconstruction and several improvements were needed.
Execution of deliverables in Milestone 1 was therefore postponed to February 2023 and was consider accomplished by our team April 30th.   

As conclusion from Milestone 1: 
- The Lost Diamond MVP is not a good user-experience. 50 unique people have started the step for sign-in-with-anchor, but aborted when it gets too complicated. The Lost Diamond needs to deliver a high-quality user experience to be successful.
- We need more work and focus on creating YouTube-videos with great stories around the hunt for the lost diamond and how the EOS blockchain makes it possible to send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds, to onboard users. 

What is the definition of a user: A user that conquers, creates or gets rewarded when a NFT Checkpoint challenge is solved.
What is the current user baseline: 17 users (https://cptblackbill.com/start Scoreboard April 2023).

What is the definition of a follower: A YouTube subscriber on The Lost Diamond Adventure Race YouTube-channel.
What is the current follower baseline: 58 YouTube-subscribers. (https://www.youtube.com/@thelostdiamondrace)

What is the Objective Key Result for The Lost Diamond project:
- Objective: To build The Lost Diamond to be a successful YouTube-GameFi-show and the most exciting treasure hunt everyone will love. As a channel to promote the awesome capabilities the EOS blockchain has - to people that are outside the crypto space.

Key Results:
- 22% monthly growth in YouTube subscribers.
- 22% monthly growth in organic views.
- 22% monthly active users growth in TheLostDiamond $7 dollar subscription fee.

What is the explicit target number of followers, users and transactions given the baseline:
- 1 million YouTube-subscribers
- 50,000 mau are paying a $7 monthly subscription fee.
- We are ranking in the top five on EOS Dapp-radar.

### Ecosystem Fit

The main goal of TheLostDiamond project is ecosystem growth.

The EOS blockchain is maybe the first financial platform in the world - that is able to send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds with no fees.

That message needs to be delivered! With entertaining use-cases that people outside the crypto space understand.

The Lost Diamond is custom made to do exactly that. With a golden thread in every video

“The EOS blockchain can send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds. And with a VISA-card from Coinbase, you can spend that money in your local store just a few minutes later.”

We are not aware of other similar real-world P2E adventure game projects in the EOSIO or other related ecosystems.
