## Project Overview

This application is in response to an RFP. (Open application process)

### Overview

The Lost Diamond is a real-world P2E adventure race where the goal is to find The Lost Diamond by conquering checkpoints all around the world.
A fun, exciting and easy-to-understand GameFi project to let people discover and learn about EOS, Web3 and NFTs.

This 90 second intro video will give a good overview: https://youtu.be/3BKr1uY6nZ8

The EOS Mainnet is the only technology platform available that has the requirements needed to make TheLostDiamond race work: 
- Instant transactions to anyone in the world
- No fees for the users 
- The option to transfer EOS-tokens to Coinbase/Binance to let the users spend the money earned by using a crypto debit card.
- The most user friendly tools (e.g. Anchor, Port, Bloks.io) 

Our team has been involved in EOS since 2018 and we want to contribute to the ecosystem's growth and teach people outside the crypto space how blockchain technology can be used in a fun and educational way.


### Project Details

Our team has an ambitious long term commitment to make TheLostDiamond one of the most popular social platforms for outdoor activities, with millions of monthly active users.

150 million people are hunting virtual monsters on PokémonGo. By utilizing EOS, we have the opportunity and advantage to replace virtual monsters with real money in a new real-world adventure game that is fun and exciting for everyone. This is a great way to teach non-tech people about the EOS-ecosystem and the possibilities in web3 applications.

For people to adapt a new technology in mass, it needs to improve their lives by an order of magnitude. 
It’s not an easy task to motivate non-tech people to create an EOS-account, download and learn how to use Anchor sign-in or create a Coinbase account. It’s a steep learning curve.

TheLostDiamond solves this by having a $1,000 dollar lost diamond as incentive for participating. Also, the concept of a treasure hunt is fun and easy to understand for everyone. 

The Lost Diamond is free to use for everyone. Everyone can conquer one checkpoint per day in the free tier.
A premium paid tier is available, where participants pay a $7 dollar monthly fee to conquer unlimited checkpoints per day. 

The smartcontract returns 80% back to the Play2Earn model to fund the lost diamonds. A true Web3 application where everyone can create, own and monetize their content.

We are aiming for 1 million users (0.65% market share from PokémonGo) within four years.

TheLostDiamond will be self-sustaining at 5,000 active users per month. 

Until we reach a self-sustaining level, we need to fund the $1,000 dollar lost diamonds from sponsors, grants, investors and/or entry fees from other single-event races. 

The value of The Lost Diamond is now $1,000 dollars (funded by the ENF GF grant i Milestone 1). The Lost Diamond race is online, if you sign in with Anchor - and if you find The Lost Diamond, you and the checkpoint creator will both get $1,000 dollars - instantly paid out to your EOS-account.

The goal for Milestone 1 was to prove that The Lost Diamond MVP could onboard participants that paid a $7 dollar monthly subscription fee and obtain a 22% monthly growth rate over two months. That was not possible to achieve on The Lost Diamond version 2022. A major reconstruction and several improvements were needed.
Execution of deliverables in Milestone 1 was therefore postponed to February 2023 and was consider accomplished by our team April 30th.   

As conclusion from Milestone 1: 
- The Lost Diamond MVP is not a good user-experience. 50 unique people have started the step for sign-in-with-anchor, but aborted when it gets too complicated. The Lost Diamond needs to deliver a high-quality user experience to be successful.
- We need more work and focus on creating YouTube-videos with great stories around the hunt for the lost diamond and how the EOS blockchain makes it possible to send moeny to anyone in the world in less than three seconds, to onboard users. 

What is the definition of a user: A user that conquers, creates or gets rewarded when a NFT Checkpoint challenge is solved.
What is the current user baseline: 17 users (https://cptblackbill.com/start Scoreboard April 2023).

What is the definition of a follower: A YouTube subscriber on The Lost Diamond Adventure Race YouTube-channel.
What is the current follower baseline: 58 YouTube-subscribers. (https://www.youtube.com/@thelostdiamondrace)

What is the Objective Key Result for The Lost Diamond project:
- Objective: To build The Lost Diamond to be a successful YouTube-GameFi-show and the most exciting treasure hunt everyone will love. As a channel to promote the awesome capabilities the EOS blockchain has - to people that are outside the crypto space.

Key Results:
- 22% monthly growth in YouTube subscribers.
- 22% monthly growth in organic views.
- 22% monthly active users growth in TheLostDiamond $7 dollar subscribtion fee.

What is the explicit target number of followers, users and transactions given the baseline:
- 1 million YouTube-subscribers
- 50,000 mau are paying a $7 monthly subscription fee.
- We are ranking in the top five on EOS Dapp-radar.

### Ecosystem Fit

The main goal of TheLostDiamond project is ecosystem growth.

The EOS blockchain is maybe the first financial platform in the world - that is able to send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds with no fees.

That message needs to be delivered! With entertaining use-cases that people outside the crypto space understand.

The Lost Diamond is custom made to do exactly that. With a golden thread in every video

“The EOS blockchain can send money to anyone in the world in less than three seconds. And with a VISA-card from Coinbase, you can spend that money in your local store just a few minutes later.”

We are not aware of other similar real-world P2E adventure game projects in the EOSIO or other related ecosystems.

## Future Plans

The market rollout strategy is divided into 24 monthly marketing campaigns. Each with a key result goal of 22% average growth rate.

The main capital of Norway is our starting point with a new $1,000 dollar diamond every week, acting as the main motivation for the users to join the game.

With a 22% monthly average growth rate, the goal is to reach 10,000 monthly users within 24 months. And one million monthly users within four years.
The first $10,000 dollar diamond will be added to the game when we reach 5,000 monthly users.

Building trust and success stories around The Lost Diamond brand, will be the most important success factor for onboarding users to a new technology.  

We will host public diamond-events around big cities, invite social media influencers and use the traditional media to build trust around The Lost Diamond brand over a long period of time.

Weekly tweets and YouTube videos will be published to promote The Lost Diamond and the eos-ecosystem.

Our business model has two different versions depending on how our project will be funded: 
- An investor versjon, where a 20% dividend of the revenue is paid out to the investor. 
- A public good version, where all revenue is returned back to the users. 

Our project has been self-funded since we launched the first version of the smartcontract on July 2018.
