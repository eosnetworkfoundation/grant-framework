    Tag line: AI driven advertising token system

    Brief Description: 
    Birble is an innovative advertising token that seeks to bring together crypto projects to maximize their spending and customer 
    reach while being the driving force of marketing crypto projects to the rest of the world. With the ADD Model, 
    we aim to ensure the cooperation of many projects through the money they will save while obtaining their social out-reach goals. 
    Our mission is to organize viable crypto projects into an 
    advertising conglomerate whose funds are pooled into our advertising funds in order to spend them in the most 
    effective manner with us using all mediums 
    available and guided by artificial intelligence. We believe that Birble will pave the way for a new era of advertising 
    through artificial intelligence and 
    analytic review that will ultimately prove to be the best marketing tool while ensuring the best use of time and money spent 
    for the clients and partners 
    involved.
    By offering a comprehensive selection of open source, web3 and AI-driven applications that are both free and user-friendly, 
    we will be able to achieve our goals.

    Relationship to EOS Network /
    Birble AI wants to integrate its existing DAPPs into the EOS blockchain because it offers a number of advantages over other blockchains. 
    The EOS blockchain is highly scalable, secure, and provides low transaction fees. Additionally, the EOS blockchain has a large and active 
    developer community that can help Birble AI build and maintain its applications. Finally, the EOS blockchain is designed to support 
    decentralized applications (DAPPs) which makes it an ideal platform for Birble AI to build future applications on.

    Reason for Interest: Birble AI is interested in building on the EOS blockchain because it offers a high level of scalability, 
    security, and flexibility. The EOS blockchain is designed to handle millions of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications 
    that require high throughput (examples or NFT games and music and video streaming apps). 
    Additionally, the EOS blockchain is built with a robust security model that ensures data integrity and privacy. 
    Finally, the EOS blockchain provides developers with a wide range of tools and features that make it easy to build custom applications. 
    All of these features make the EOS blockchain an attractive platform for Birble AI to build on.

Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. 
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here. 
Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, 
plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that
everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. 
We recommend that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

    make sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
    include the amount of funding requested per milestone.
    include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
    provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
    commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
    indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
    Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

    ⚡ If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

      Providing the world with passive income through our advanced AI advertising model. Our revenue model is straightforward and effective. 
      We do not charge fees for any of the products or services we offer, instead relying on our innovative advertising model to generate revenue. 
      Vendors must purchase “Add Blocks” with the BirbleAI token, creating buy pressure on the open market and allowing token holders to benefit from this activity.
      We have many working products in our portfolio and many on test net and sandbox environment almost ready for main net, check our services page for links and details. (https://www.birble.win/services/)
      How our proposed Advertising Model will work:
      The ADD Model of Birble is a comprehensive approach to advertising that utilizes the BirbleAI token to purchase advertising space on our sites and partner sites, 
      as well as join any social media campaigns. As we expand our reach to other platforms and develop relationships with agencies and influencers, these services 
      will only be available for purchase with the BirbleAI token. To maximize the effectiveness of a client’s money and ensure their message is delivered, we are 
      utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms to determine the best use of resources. We are also developing our own Birble Artificial Intelligence Aggregator 
      to refine results and guide marketing campaigns. Until this is implemented, we will use a cooperative structure for clients and partners to spread out the cost 
      of campaigns across various crypto projects while delivering their intended message. This approach will reduce time spent and money wasted on misguided marketing 
      efforts. For example, a potential client could purchase ad space on our sites and partner sites with the BirbleAI token. They could also join any social media 
      campaigns that we are running with our various partners. Our AI algorithms will be used to determine the best use of resources for their campaign, and our 
      AI Aggregator will refine results and guide their marketing efforts. Finally, they can take advantage of our cooperative structure to spread out the cost of 
      their campaign across various campaigns along with other crypto projects while still delivering their intended message.

         Key Advantages:
       Advertise quickly and change AD or campaign as needed to suite the projects individual needs. 
       Advertise within the ecosystem your project is being used and with other projects to create synergy. 
       Projects with a smaller budget will finally be able to take part in larger campaigns for a longer period of time. 
       Cross promotion between a larger group of participants with custom made conglomerate ads in the same particular sect or 
       niche or even a niche complimenting one another and therefor maximizing a customer’s time spent viewing adds. 
       Be part of a larger ad pool on a limited budget but still allowing you to reach the desired audience with no contract obligated time line.
       Easily Reach High-intent, High-value Audiences with Predictions Our prediction templates powered by smart machine learning algorithms will 
       help you create intelligent and highly targeted campaigns, so projects and clients can reach the right audience at the right time on the channel
       that’s preferred by them. Built-in Analytics and Customer Journey Insights, truly insightful and impactful personalization can only be achieved when 
       customer behavior is understood and anticipated. With Birble AI Aggregator, personalization is pre-built with advanced customer journey analytics that 
       visualize and quickly target the right segments, so you’re never wasting money - all available right from the customer dashboard. Streamlines marketing 
       efforts with Deep learning through Artificial Intelligence allows us to more accurately identify user behavior and predict which segments are more likely 
       to become customers. Programs can provide specific information related to which leads will probably convert, allowing marketers to target their efforts 
       based on detailed demographics – without wasting time on less probable leads again saving money and time.
