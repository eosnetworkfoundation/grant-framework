# EOS Network Foundation Grant Proposal

-   **Project Name:** EOS Bees
-   **Team Name:** EOS Bees
-   **EOS Payment Address:** queenhp.gm
-   **[Level](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework#grant-levels):** 3
-   **Project is Open-Source:** Yes
-   **Project was part of Token sale:** No
-   **Repository where Project resides:** https://github.com/eosbeeswarms/Contracts


## Project Overview

This proposal is for EOS Bees to make EOS video content available to non-English speakers, amplify EOS Tweets and qualify/rank mid-level crypto influencers. This proposal represents Phase 1 of 3; a graudual plan to cement a positive narrative for EOS. 

### Overview

-   **Name:** EOS Bees
-   **Brief Description:** EOS Bees was created for the purpose of marketing the EOS community and its ecosystem. We adhere to the principle of mutual respect called the Bee Code. We promote the EOS community in a positive way, which allows us to contribute to the growth of the EOS ecosystem. 
-   **Relationship to EOSIO:** Uses EOSIO smart contracts, ueses $EOS as currency
-   **Reason for Interest:** EOS Bees has created a new way to amplify Tweets and qualify leads (influencers) in multiple languages.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

We aim to amplify content from the EOS ecosystem on Twitter using an innovative method that incentivizes engagement. 

**Who is your target audience?**

Non-English speaking EOS community members and mid-level crypto influencers (5000 - 100000 followers)

**What need(s) does your project meet?**

EOS needs a new, positive narrative in order to gain respect from the broader crypto community. These efforts from the community need to be amplified in order to meaningfully impact the narrative. 


## Team

We have multiple roles that comprise our full team. Our goal is to recruit thousands of people whose sole job is to like and ReTweet or Quote ReTweet content from our Swarms. We expect to surpass 500 bees by the conclusion of the proposed timeline.

### Project Details

**1. Goals & Objectives**

The EOS ecosystem is more active than ever since the launch of EOS Network Foundation (ENF).  
In order to accelerate the activity, we will act directly to make the contents of the ENF and the EOS ecosystem more accessible to EOS community members and crypto influencers worldwide. 
To make this possible, we have set the following step-by-step process: 

- Step 1. Translate the subtitles of important videos from the EOS community into our 10 languages.

- Step 2. Promote the translated contents of the EOS community in multiple languages on social media. We use an organized social media marketing method called the "Swarm", which is built in collaboration with Tipit. 

- Step 3. Rank influencers. Step 1 and 2 help inform which influencers are most qualified for EOS. The algorithm we developed will rank influencers based on key engagement and qualification metrics, including their response to a Swarm. 

**2. Targeting**

Firstly, we are targeting the EOS community members who cannot consume English video content. The translation step is critical to increase community engagement. Secondly, Swarming the content will allow us reach mid-level influencers, defined as having a following of approximately 5,000 to 100,000 people. 

Influencers are the most efficient route to reach crypto enthusiasts, in order to eventually convert them to EOS community members. Our main platforms of focus are Twitter and YouTube. Outside of the three primary EOS languages, we can expect the total pool of crypto enthusiasts to be approximately 3,500,000 on Twitter and 50,000,000 on YouTube. 

The following EOS videos we propose have the most relevant information for crypto influencers:

- Fireside Chat : General alpha updates; relevant to influencer depending on topic of update
- EOS Hot Sauce : Aggregating EOS News; relevant to influencer depending on topic of news
- EDEN Chief Delegate Meetings : DAO, governance-interested influencers

**3. Methods**

3.1 Translation

EOS Bees' translations are checked by EOS OG language leaders to ensure their quality. Each language leader also manages translators to help them. Translation in EOS Bees minimizes paraphrasing and instead chooses direct translation so that the content of blockchain technology can be conveyed without misunderstanding. 

Working with subtitles is the lowest hanging fruit in the translation space due to YouTube’s AI voice-to-text proficiency, lack of competition and [behavioral trends.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2019/07/31/verizon-media-says-69-percent-of-consumers-watching-video-with-sound-off/?sh=73253c3135d8)


3.2 Marketing

Marketing activities are mainly done using a 'Swarm'. All Bees in all languages work to influence Twitter’s distribution algorithm via like and RT or Quote RT. Depending on the target language/influencer, Bees will reach out via replies and Quote ReTweets while tagging relevant influencers with professionally written copy. We believe Swarming will elevate the content to be adopted by the platform algorithm to create secondary effects.

3.3 Influencer Research

Research is done by data mining publicly available information about the influencers, including following, engagement and interest metrics. We have developed an algorithm that factors in other variables like Swarm response and conversational reactions. The algorithm is designed to predict the value of the influencer with suggested prices. The influencers are ranked by the best deal, factoring in all the variables given. The scope of this Proposal covers Steps 1 and 2 from the diagram below.

3.4 Operations

The languages will take turns translating subtitles + Swarming the content. In Month 1, one language per video will execute the process. In Month 2, two languages per video and in Month 3, three languages per video will translate + Swarm the content. This method is used to save costs and to qualify the languages using benchmarks. The languages that fail to reach them will be deprecated from the EOS Bees organization.

The suggested benchmarks per month for a 3 month average:

- 500k Twitter impressions per language team
- 10% of total English video watch time 

*EOS Bees requests Manager access to ENF and EOSN's YouTube account to streamline data mining

For Yves’ account, we propose to Swarm two Tweets per week, selected by Yves, to English, Korean and Chinese influencers. Swarms will initiate on Monday and Thursday of each week.

3.5 Macro Benchmark

In order to detect changes in engagement relative to the crypto market, we have compiled a list of average video views across 60+ crypto YouTube influencers for the last 3 months, including the three videos we are proposing to promote. We will continue to track their video views in Q3. If our proposal increases views meaningfully, then the increase in Q3 should be substantially more than the average increase in views across crypto YouTube channels.

## Development Status

EOS Bees has been working for the past 6 months to create the "Swarm", an innovative marketing method that is currently in BETA. All functionality including payments for Twitter engagements, NFT membership system, integrations with the Twitter API and Swarm registration is operational. We need more volume to explore more edge cases.

## Conclusion

EOS Bees has finally found its wings; an achievable, detailed, gradual plan to popularize a positive narrative for EOS. 

It’s time to fly EOS to the vacant throne of smart contract platforms.

With the support of the EOS Network Foundation, the throne is ours. 

Thank you.
