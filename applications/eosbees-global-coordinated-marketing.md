## Project Overview

This proposal is for EOS Bees to provide public good marketing services to the EOS ecosystem.

### Overview

-   **Name:** EOS Bees 3.0 - provide global coordinated marketing service for EOS ecosystem
-   **Brief Description:** EOS Bees was created for the purpose of marketing the EOS community and its ecosystem. We adhere to the marketing principle of mutual respect called the Bee Code. We promote the EOS community in a positive way, which allows us to contribute to the growth of the EOS ecosystem. 
-   **Relationship to EOSIO:** 
-   **Reason for Interest:** EOS Bees has created a new way to amplify messages and qualify leads (influencers) in multiple languages.

### Project Details

**1. Goals & Objectives**

The EOS ecosystem is more active than ever since the launch of EOS Network Foundation (ENF).  
In order to accelerate the activity, we will act directly to make the contents of the ENF and the EOS ecosystem more accessible to EOS community members and crypto influencers worldwide. 
To make this possible, we have set the following step-by-step process: 

- Step 1. Translate the subtitles of important videos from the EOS community into our 10 languages.

- Step 2. Promote the translated contents of the EOS community in multiple languages on social media.We use an organized social media marketing method called "Swarming", which was built in collaboration with Tipit. 

- Step 3. Through Step 1 and 2, we organize the marketing data accumulated by influencer and language, and provide it to the EOS community as an open source asset. The algorithm we developed will rank influencers based on key engagement and qualification metrics, including their response to a Swarm. 

**2. Targeting**

Firstly, we are targeting the EOS community members who cannot consume English video content. The translation step is critical to increase community engagement. Secondly, Swarming the content will allow us reach mid-level influencers, defined as having a following of approximately 5,000 to 100,000 people. 

Influencers are the most efficient route to reach crypto enthusiasts, in order to eventually convert them to EOS community members. Our main platforms of focus are Twitter and YouTube. Outside of the three primary EOS languages, we can expect the total pool of crypto enthusiasts to be approximately 3,500,000 on Twitter and 50,000,000 on YouTube. 
The following EOS videos we propose have the most relevant information for crypto influencers:

- Fireside Chat : General alpha updates; relevant to influencer depending on topic of update
- EOS Hot Sauce : Aggregating EOS News; relevant to influencer depending on topic of news
- EDEN Chief Delegate Meetings : DAO, governance-interested influencers

**3. Methods**

3.1 Translation

EOS Bees' translations are checked by EOS OG language leaders to ensure their quality. Each language leader also manages translators to help them. Translation in EOS Bees minimizes paraphrasing and instead chooses direct translation so that the content of blockchain technology can be conveyed without misunderstanding. 

Working with subtitles is the lowest hanging fruit in the translation space due to YouTube’s AI voice-to-text proficiency, lack of competition and [behavioral trends.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2019/07/31/verizon-media-says-69-percent-of-consumers-watching-video-with-sound-off/?sh=73253c3135d8)

3.2 Marketing

Marketing activities are mainly done using a 'Swarm'. All Bees in all languages work to influence Twitter’s distribution algorithm via like and RT or Quote RT. Depending on the target language/influencer, Bees will reach out via replies and Quote ReTweets while tagging relevant influencers. Coordinating all the languages in one common goal is more influential than conventional social media marketing activities. The content has a greater chance to be adopted by the platform algorithm to create secondary effects.

3.3 Influencer Research

Research is done by data mining publicly available information about the influencers, including following, engagement and interest metrics. We have developed an algorithm that factors in other variables like Swarm response and conversational reactions. The algorithm is designed to predict the value of the influencer with suggested prices. The influencers are ranked by the best deal, factoring in all the variables. The scope of this Proposal covers Steps 1 and 2 from the diagram below.

3.4 Operations

The languages will take turns translating subtitles + Swarming the content. In Month 1, one language per video will execute the process. In Month 2, two languages per video and in Month 3, three languages per video will translate + Swarm the content. This method is used to save costs and to qualify the languages using benchmarks. The languages that fail to reach them will be deprecated from the EOS Bees organization. 

The suggested benchmarks per month for a 3 month average:
- 500k Twitter impressions per language team
- 10% of total video watch time in English
*EOS Bees requests Manager access to ENF’s YouTube account to streamline data mining

3.5 Macro Benchmark

In order to detect changes in engagement relative to the crypto market, we have compiled a list of average video views across 60+ crypto YouTube influencers for the last 3 months, including the three videos we are proposing to promote. We will continue to track their video views in Q3. If our proposal increases views meaningfully, then the increase in Q3 should be substantially more than the average increase in views across crypto YouTube channels in general.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

We aim to amplify content from the EOS ecosystem on Twitter using an innovative method that incentivizes engagement. 

**Who is your target audience?**

Non-English speaking EOS community members and mid-level crypto influencers (5000 - 100000 followers)

**What need(s) does your project meet?**

EOS needs a new, positive narrative in order to gain respect from the broader crypto community. These efforts from the community need to be amplified in order to meaningfully impact the narrative. 


## Team

We have multiple roles that comprise our full team. Our goal is to recruit thousands of people whose sole job is to like and ReTweet or Quote ReTweet content from our Swarms. We expect to surpass 500 bees by the conclusion of the proposed timeline.

## Development Status

EOS Bees has been working for the past 6 months to build Swarming, an innovative marketing method and a kind of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (autonomous participation, micro-reward, powered by EOSIO smart contract).

We will use our efforts as a stepping stone to take step-by-step steps to provide a true public good to the EOS ecosystem.

EOS Bees has put great effort towards the EOS community since the idea was first presented in September 2021.

EOS Bees, as a global marketing organization, focused on creating a system to hire hundreds of members who can move in unison.

Now it’s time for EOS Bees to help blossom the flowers of the EOS ecosystem. 

With the support of the EOS Network Foundation, we can confidently say that we can achieve our goals in a shorter time with more efficient processes and members.
