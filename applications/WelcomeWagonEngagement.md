## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Welcomewagon Onboarding & Engagement
- **Brief Description:** Product Information and Pricelist for physical cards
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Welcomewagon.ai will be an onboarding & engagement service for all coalition chains, and our printed cards will be used worldwide to onboard real people.
- **Reason for Interest:** We want to make EOS easy and fun for everyone. With many more project ideas to come, we need onboarding and engagement solved first.

### Project Details

We have built a Proof-of-Concept https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/6-Cards%20PoC%20%26%20Phone%20Mockup.jpg for a system that abbreviates 
long-form URLs for EOS account creation and for NFT claims into custom-domain-shortened URLs and simple QR codes. 
It will allow us to build using traditional infrastructure and user databases, yet link to EOS accounts, and reward them with NFTs for accomplishing simple tasks.
The first of these simple tasks is the use of a printed card to create a .gm EOS account, and the NFT reward for this task is claimed by using the link on the same card.

Using standard web tools such as URL shorteners, G-suite, & CRM in conjunction with the Greymass account creation process & AtomicAssets NFT gifts, we are able
to create a database of URLs (both in text and QR) from which we can create print material. At this point it is not fully automated, and the cost of the cards is 
reflective of this fact. Work is currently underway to alleviate this constraint.

Production of the printed material requires research and experimentation with graphical layout software (and its integration with our database of URLs) to populate 
large quantities of business cards and posters. As batches of business cards are successfully printed, they need to be distributed to on-the-ground onboarding 
opportunities, such as blockchain conferences or to social movements like EOS Marketplace, and local meetups. In order to properly measure the effectiveness of this
method as an onboarding tool, we will have to collect and analyze every bit of data created. We are currently developing a list of potential test partners who could
take a set of cards and commit to their distribution. This printing and distribution process will give us an idea of the value of these cards to the market and the 
EOS Network. 

We also plan on creating testing cards that will have QR codes that would automatically recharge, allowing the bearer to repeatedly distribute new EOS accounts and 
NFTs.

The most serious immediate limitation is the production of the NFT gift claim links, which must be done manually and individually.

There are concerns with the security of 7-digit abreviated URLs against brute force attacks, but at this stage it is not an issue, because we are dealing with
extremely low-value claim links, and because we are still unknown. In the future though, especially with the permanent cards, or with cards that contain backed NFTs
(eg.'Claim this NFT backed by 10 EOS') the danger could be mitigated in several ways, such as SMS confirmation. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Welcomewagon.ai is 'the smart engagement solution for your web3 destination'.
Our mission is to make the EOS experience easy and fun for all users. By intentifying our users' profiles and offering them a journey tailored to their level of experience, 
we hope to quickly make an impact in the EOS and EOSIO ecosystems. We hope that by offering the simplest of interactions with our newly onboarded users, they will 
come back to welcomewagon to learn more about the network. Dapps and other destinations will want to partner with us to direct the new users their way. If this model is 
successful, networks will wish to partner with us to enhance their general ecosystem. 
We hope to very quickly have a large collection of concise e-learning materials, which will be free for anyone to view (only welcomewagon members will be rewarded with NFTs
for watching the material.)

In the meantime though, we want to focus on the production of our QR cards as we move into trade-show season, as colleges and universities resume, and as social movements like
Hu-Fi and Eden gain traction. The onboarding potential is massive, if these cards are put into the right hands. Distributors who order batches of the cards will be able to customize
them with their own NFT, and will be forever linked to the account that they helped to onboard. 

We are not aware of any other EOSIO project that is doing what we have built: Simple onboarding + incentivized learning. Several projects are doing one or the other.. 
Wombat wallet offers free accounts (via socials login) and then promotes specific dapps and destinations, but does not offer concerted e-learning. Other educational initiatives
from the EOS community do not offer short, focused video learning modules, and do not reward viewers with NFTs. We know of no other product across 
EOSIO - or any other chain - that accomplishes what our business cards do. We intend to help our users learn by walking them thru simple processes - and then
immediately rewarding them for their effort. 

With our first generation of cards, we prove that it is possible and desireable to have a physical touchstone to our network. With unique and attractive cards, we 
hope to move our intended audience to try out the account creation process. As proven in this video https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/Greymass%20Account%20Creation%20and%20NFT%20Claim%20on%20Android_2.mp4, it is possible to complete the process in two and a half minutes.
When both the account is created and the NFT claimed, we will have successfully acquired a new EOS user, who will hopefully want to learn more about the network. We
intend to use the advanced analytical tools built into our URLs to help understand and improve upon our cards' success rate. Over time, production costs will decrease
and we believe that the cards' effectiveness will increase.  

On other networks, these types of 'real world' blockchain interactions are difficult to find, if they exist at all.

## Development Status

Beginning in the fall of 2021, I (Chuck) began experimenting with the Greymass account creation process, and became aware that the sharing of those urls could lead 
somewhere interesting for onboarding on EOS. After several conversations with Aaron Cox of Greymass, an experimental set of codes was given to me, and I began sharing
the codes with friends and family. The process was still rather rough, but I was able to help most people get thru it. This past spring, I began experimenting with 
QR codes in print, and found that results were far better when using an abreviated url. https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/0-Account%20claim%20Component.png
I was able to produce a large handbill (1/2 a page) that contained several codes on it. https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/1-Handbill%20Page%20Front%201.png
https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/2-Handbill%20Page%20Reverse.png I gave a number of public and private talks on 'Real Life Implications of the 
Bitcoin Sector', featuring EOS and Eden. While a bit convoluted, the talks were successful in raising awareness, and they helped me to further hone my onboarding 
delivery. Around this time I was developing a friendship with Domenic Thomas of Agenix, and we decided to become partners in this venture. During my time in Eden I 
have seen the value of authentic relationships between real people when onboarding, and it led me to create a very simple physical product that could be shared between
individuals in person. This opens the door to 'Real Life' organizations bringing their entire membership list onto EOS if they have a compelling reason to do it. 
This will allow representatives at trade shows to hand out a real EOS account to someone they are speaking with, even handing them another card that contains a gift 
of an NFT backed by 1, 5, 10 or more EOS.https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/3-Card%20PoC%20Front.png https://github.com/ChuckMacDonald/welcomewagon/blob/main/4-Card%20PoC%20Back1.png

We are now reaching out to organizations and networks who might like to partner with us to test these cards with their communities.
We are building welcomewagon.ai on web2 standards, integrating with CRM, and limiting (at this time) blockchain integrations to claim links, so that we
can build our MVP as quickly and efficiently as possible. Above all, we want our product to be functional at each step of its development. The cards work today, 
although they are built using a method that is more far manual than we would like.
We have also secured a bulk printing deal with our printer, for a flat discount across all order sizes.

(Any accounts that claim more than one NFT shall count as 1 successful card)
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains to the public what the cards are, what they can ideally accomplish, and a report on their success rate in their first iteration.
| 1. | Report | The report to the ENF will be a .pdf with summaries of all the data collected from the cards and recommendations on how we can improve their success rates for future distributions.
 


## Future Plans

Once the cards can be produced in bulk, we will turn our attention to a process for ordering them on the welcomewagon.ai website. While we are building a solution for
ordering them, we plan to rely on direct sales contact with our customers.. 

When the cards begin to achieve success in Real Life settings, we anticipate an overwhelming demand for them. When we have users coming to welcomewagon.ai because of the cards or because of another referral in the EOS ecosystem, we will generate large quantities of valuable data on EOS users and their tendancies. This data will be valuable to dapps and other destinations. Through focused, short e-learning sessions, we will educate our users on the network and dapps, and our e-learning department will grow, as it takes on more clients that need material made for them. We are building this prototype on EOS, but will also onboard to EOS Coalition chains and engage using the same mechanisms as on EOS (the Greymass account creation process, and NFTs). We will also be one of the first users for Greymass's process when it allows other custom domains. We have 2-letter name-space domains on each network that we plan to use in that eventuality.

Apart from the potential for printed links, we will also offer our solution as a way to provide organizations with a bulk digital onboarding solution. eg. "This email
contains instructions for you to create your new EOS account and claim this community's membership NFT"

The future of blockchain interactions in print is very bright, especially when NFC chips and AR are added into the mix. We envision persistant signage at Points-of-sale, NFC account faucets in public places, guerilla marketing such as stickers at drive-thru windows, and cards like ours passed out at mass gatherings of people - festivals, concerts, sporting events, protests, etc. 

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**

We heard about the Grants Program thru regular EOS channels - Everything EOS, ENF press releases, etc. 

We are confident that our onboarding & engagement technique is something that all EOSIO networks urgently require, and that these networks will see value in subsidizing its development. 

While our cards can now be ordered in bulk quantities, we are still working to refine and automate the ordering and creation process.  The major work still outstanding
is mostly technical - the API scripting and either web or in-house services to scale it up.

We have been in consultation with many specialists in the EOSIO community, especially Greymass and BountyBlok.
No other teams have contributed financially to this project. 

We are excited to offer our solution to the EOSIO community as it prepares for the rollout of its new branding.
