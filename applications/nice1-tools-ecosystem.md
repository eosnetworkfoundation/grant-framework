## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Nice1 
- **Brief Description:** We develop services and applications based on Blockchain technology for video games, aimed at democratizing the video game industry by giving developers the necessary tools to implement all its advantages in licenses, assets or skins.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The use of EOS accounts for login and identity verification in video games, as well as the use of NFT over the same network for license and asset verification along with the free transfer of assets in the EOS network (in the future in sisterchains).
- **Reason for Interest:** The need to democratize the current privatization in the world of video games, where all acquisitions do not promote the same as in the beginning since we are no longer holders of the physical game, which in the past gave us a freedom, now all games and assets are linked to an email account, which does not allow the free transfer of games and assets in addition to a possibility of censorship by being able to be removed our access to the servers of the major distributors.


### Project Details

- **Current MVP:**  “Legendary legends” demo game with 3 built-in game mechanics (game license validation, character selection and reward for ingame objectives).
Created using the Nice1 plug-in.

   - An NFT based game licensing system integrating login with Anchorwallet (Thread): https://twitter.com/Nice1BlockChain/status/1456053844367089665 

   - MACos and anchor mobile mechanics video demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V_R4EwNvgqzN-kKTW-YB8ZFOZdUn3fjQ/view

   - Legendary Legends (Jungle3) link: https://nice1-blockchain.itch.io/legendary-legends


We are currently pursuing two main lines of development:

- **A. Nice1 Plugins:** Tools for developers through plugins for the main IDEs in the market. These tools provide developers with the possibility to implement NFT with free terms of use, simple integration and no fee transactions between players and creators. The goal is to have a common source code written in C++ that can be compiled for the different IDEs. For each of them, it will be necessary to make the necessary adaptations according to their requirements. In addition, it will be necessary to adapt the code to the different platforms. As a common goal, for each IDE, adaptation to PC, Mac, Android and iOS.
At this point, we can separate the development into two branches: a first one destined for the development of the adaptations for each IDE-platform; and a second one for the development of the plugin functionalities. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the objective is to have a single source code from which to generate the adaptations for each IDE-platform. 

  - A1. IDEs:
A1.1 Unity: In the current version of the unity plugin the anchor-link connection is made through a third-party webview plugin. To solve this problem we propose in this project the development of our cross-platform webview plugin. In addition, in parallel, explore the development of a C# module for Anchor-link. As a third task, finalize the adaptation of the current plugin to Mac, Android and iOS operating systems. 
A1.2 Unreal: Adapt the first version of the plugin to the Unreal engine for PC, Mac, Android and iOS platforms. 

  - A2. Functionalities
A2.1 Connection and deserialization: Although there is already a first solution for the connection with the different networks and the deserialization of the collected information, it is necessary to review the implementation as well as the current architecture to find a more optimal solution. 
A2.2 LegendaryLegends Demo: A PC demo is available to test the Nice1 licensing system: Legendary Legends. To make the source code of the demo available to the community, it is necessary to perform several tasks: removal of dependency with third-party plugins, adaptation to the latest version of the plugin and bug fixes. 
A2.3 Extend EOS networks support: Telos, Proton, EOS, WAX, mainnet and testnet for all. 
A2.4 Use of audited mechanics contracts: Manage from the plugin itself the contracts on different mechanics (licenses, character selection, etc) that we will develop. In this way, the game developer will only have to select the type of mechanics and configure the required parameters.


- **B. Nice1 Link:** WebPortal for players, which allows crypto and non-crypto users the complete management of:Their accounts, Tokens, Licenses, items, community, events, etc. in an easy, fast and transparent way.


## Ecosystem Fit

- ***Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?*** This project fits between developers and players, giving developers the opportunity to take full control of their creations and develop new business models and giving back to players full control over their acquired licenses, allowing them as in the past to sell, exchange or donate among gamers.

- ***Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?*** GameDevs , Gamers, blockchain developers and Videogame Industry

- ***What need(s) does your project meet?*** To give free access to the management of video game licenses as well as skins and assets acquired through the current micropayment systems.

- ***Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?*** None with our focus
  - ***If so, how is your project different?***
  - ***If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?*** ULTRA , which created its own chain to make a distributor of video games without NFT licenses and to sell art NFTs..., but due to the cost of the fees and other factors we do not believe that viable things will come out in BNB or ETH in the short term.

### Team Experience

Most of us on the team have grown up as gaming enthusiasts since the dawn of computer technology.  Since the birth of blockchain technology we have felt admiration for the possibilities it can offer and some members of the team have been immersed in the world of blockchain and its development practically since the currency started to be tradable. Other members of the team are enthusiasts with jobs related to the gaming industry bringing their passion and interest for these new technologies.

Nice1 was born in mid-2019 with the idea of giving back to gamers thanks to blockchain technology the possibility to become again the real owners of the acquired video game licenses.  Giving back to gamers the right to the property they pay for and giving developers the tools to be able to offer their games and licenses in a direct and fairer market.
Our first achievement has been the recent launch of our MVP: Nice1 Plug-in, the first plug-in to log into any game using a blockchain wallet.

## Future Plans


Since the birth of nice1 our approach has been somewhat different from other projects. We have seen how this blockchain technology revolution was fueled by too many big projects and too many ghost projects that disappear as fast as they appear. There are too many companies attracted to the Play2earn market, too many companies attracted to token sales and too many market opportunists.

Nice1 projects its vision in the past, to reach a different future than the one proposed by the majority. Our romantic side as users who were once tangible owners of a product that belonged to them, is what has given us the perspective of our place in the future. It was our motivation for bringing blockchain technology and video games together, giving ownership of licenses back to both the developer and the end user. Paying for a game that is in the cloud or for items that are never under your full ownership, is not paying for something that belongs to you. This is the first thing that we need to change in the current gamming licensing system and digital items.

Since the launch of the Nice1 Plugin, our first achievement, there has been a lot of support and repercussion achieved, so far the plugin was born under the EOS blockchain but has been quickly adapted for its functionality in TELOS, PROTON and WAX.

We intend in the medium term to show a path for the GameDevs community to take advantage of the potential of the plug-in as well as the tools that we will be launching, making them participate in the development as well as providing them all the help and documentation necessary for the implementation in their projects. We want game developers to take advantage of the potential of the technology to adapt their past projects or develop new ones under a new licensing system that is fairer for both the developer and the end user.
Nice1's long-term plans are to promote this new model among gamers and for the community to adopt and adapt the use of licenses and purchased items. We want to encourage a free market of buying and selling licenses for both video games and any object acquired or earned in a video game, as in the past days physical games were sold or exchanged. 

Our main philosophy is not to promote exclusive items or NFT´s at collector prices, but to standardize the free use and trade of video game licenses through the blockchain and a free market of buying and selling or exchange. as in the old days: you finish a game and you can sell it. And so the infinity of uses that will appear.

Nice1 will focus on promoting this new market, as well as developing new tools, providing support and services to developers, funding promising projects through grants and providing consulting services.
