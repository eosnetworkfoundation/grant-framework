## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Notary of Trust [allowing notaries to approve each other using their own utility]
- **Brief Description:** Creating a notary community will allow US notaries to verify each other to collect their NFT containing their digital signature for notarizations.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** NA
- **Reason for Interest:** We used EOS quite a bit a few years ago.  We helped FedEx review the chain for a project they were considering. We have entered two teams into the SanFran hackathon and both teams ended up getting prizes.

### Project Details

We left due to the conflict internally. We love how fast and easy EOS is on the technology side. We are coming back due to Lliam Buckley explaining all the new things happening.

### Ecosystem Fit

This would be a public utility for the ecosystem.  The future of the notary industry will be blockchain-based. We are trying to get ahead of it and create a soft landing for all the RONs.

## Future Plans

## Additional Information

We would like to know if there is a way for EOS to apply for a CA/Root cert for this project? This would help create a moat around this community and technology.
