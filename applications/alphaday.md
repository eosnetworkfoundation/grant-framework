## Project Overview

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** Alphaday
- **Brief Description:** Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** As a data aggregator community dashboard, Alphaday is blockchain-agnostic.
- **Reason for Interest:** Our app is designed to generate interest, increase user engagement & retention, and educate new users with regard to cryptocurrency projects and the industry in general.

### Ecosystem Fit

Project fit: Social - A data aggregator as a Community dashboard.

Target audience: We aim to create a dashboard that serves any EOS Network user, holders, developers, VCs, and pretty much any stakeholder whether they are completely new to the EOS Network ecosystem or an expert.

Our dashboard aims to provide a single end-point from which users can consume all the information on a project they could possibly want. In this case, we would like to build a EOS Network Community Dashboard that aggregates all the discussions, talking points, narratives, events, metrics, official announcements and much much more into one single dashboard. With one glance at this dashboard EOS Network community members would have a top-down view of what is happening across the entire EOS Network ecosystem. From this view they could then jump deeper into their areas of interest (i.e. devs to dev documentation, EOS holders to twitter and reddit discussions, investors to on-chain metrics across both EOS Network’s own pages and to third-party data providers)

Alphaday has no direct competitors as it aims to recreate a crypto user’s daily workflow (i.e. their general experience) inside a single dashboard. i.e. if a EOS Network ecosystem participant wakes up, checks their portfolio, reads twitter, browses the EOS Network governance forum, listens to the latest podcast featuring EOS Network team members,  does a bit of on-chain research, instead of having this workflow spread across a dozen tabs, it’s all available within a single screen on Alphaday.

## Development Status

Our app is already live at: https://app.alphaday.com/

We have already signed several agreements with other projects and are currently working on releasing their dashboards. You can already see a few of these dashboards live in the web-app (e.g. Verasity, Impossible Finance, Arbitrum) and several more are on their way within the next month.

Besides building dashboards for specific projects, we are simultaneously working on developing and improving our app’s features, widgets, content, and performance.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 — Development and Deployment of Initial Dashboard

**Estimated Duration:** 2 months \
**FTE:**  0.5 \
**Costs:** 1,500 USD

We would like to create a EOS Network ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Blog | The latest EOS Network official announcements and blog post content |
| 2. | News | A feed of all news mentions of EOS Network from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet. |
| 3. | Calendar | A calendar containing all EOS Network events including EOS Network Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with EOS Network bounties, AMAs. | 
| 4. | Podcasts | Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by EOS Network team members. |  
| 5. | Videos | Youtube stream containing educational EOS Network content. |  
| 6. | Documentation | EOS Documentation directory. |  
| 7. | Social Media | Twitter, Discord, & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions. |  
| 8. | Other Info | FAQ, Technical Whitepaper, EOS tokenomics information. |  
| 9. | Devs & Builders | Grants and Bounties links with descriptions and other resources to guide devs and builders. |  
| 10. | Ecosystem & App | Links and descriptions of Dapps and other platforms within the EOS ecosystem. |  

We should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the EOS Network dashboard by April 2023.

Thereafter, we will maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.

Please note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as required by your team. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/  

### Milestone 2 — Maintenance

**Estimated Duration:** 12 months continuous \
**FTE:**  0.5 \
**Costs:** 1,500 USD

| 1. | Maintenance & Curation | Continuous daily maintenance and curation of content of the dashboard by a specialist over a year. |  

### Milestone Summary

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months for deployment, 12 months of maintenance.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 1 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 3,000 USD

## Future Plans

In addition to building the EOS Network dashboard, we will be constantly monitoring and improving existing features on Alphaday and adding new widgets and features as we go along. These enhancements will automatically apply to the EOS Dashboard.

In terms of numbers:
We’ve been growing MAU 40% month-on-month with minimal marketing as we wanted to build a solid and stable product before scaling up our marketing but we expect to reach 10k MAU by March and overall our goal is to 10x our MAU every year.

Considering EOSIO has 255K twitter followers and using this as a very crude proxy for community size, we would consider it a success if we could serve at least 1% of them on a monthly basis (2.55K MAU).

## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** 
EOS Network Foundation Website

If we get this grant, we will start working on the board immediately and we should have it ready within 2 months. Once we’ve launched the board, we will do user interviews and feedback sessions to tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that EOS stakeholders truly love to use.

We are in the process of applying for grants to further develop our app and dashboard. More than a dozen projects have already approved to fund us and we are currently in the process of building or have already released their dashboards. You can see the ones already released at https://app.alphaday.com/ to get a brief idea of how “https://app.alphaday.com/b/eos” would look.
