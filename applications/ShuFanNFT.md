## Project Overview

> If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful ENF grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** ShuFan NFT
- **Brief Description:** The ShuFan NFT project was founded by original illustrator ShuFan Chen, dedicated to sharing her original artwork through NFT, each NFT is unique and limited edition, and trying to be an important part of the Metaverse.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The illustration NFTs are minted on EOS blockchain, including the NFT market of https://eos.atomichub.io.
- **Reason for Interest:** ShuFan is an original artist, she loves painting, hope to share them with the world by NFT.

### Project Details

- ShuFan is a freelance illustration artist who first put his work on https://eos.atomichub.io/ on March 18, 2021, and sold it in the form of NFT 21 days later, on April 8, the first work ["Small Flower" was collected](https://eos.atomichub.io/market/sale/2230) by a collector for 1 EOS ($6.44). Since then, more works have been gradually converted into NFTs for the first launch on EOS. Up to now, the [shufan.free collection](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/shufan.free) has reached 1270 EOS in sales, [**ranking 18th** on the entire network](https://eos.atomichub.io/ranking), and it is also the **only** illustration art collection on the list.

- The current ShuFanNFT project has formed a small team and has its own official web and other media platforms. Committed to building ShuFanNFT as a brand and striving to be part of the metaverse.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Attract more traditional artists**. If ShuFan NFT project is successful on EOS, it will be very beneficial to show the advantages of NFT on EOS (fast, 0 cost, decentralization, user-friendly, etc.), and attract more traditional artists to enter the platform on EOS NFT marketplace.
- **Target audiences**. NFT enthusiasts on EOS and potential illustration art collectors are target audiences.
- **Will enrich the artwork NFT in the EOS ecosystem**. Artwork NFT is different from the popular game NFT on the market, small circulation (even only 1 Mint), high originality requirements, relatively independent between NFT, relatively high creation cost. In addition, because the illustration artwork itself has an independent collection value, the artwork NFT also has asset value, collection value, appreciation value, aesthetic value, and will increase in value over time. 
- **The earliest publishers of artwork NFTs on EOS**. ShuFan is an early explorer in the field of illustration NFTs, one of the earliest publishers of artwork NFTs on EOS, and is currently the highest-selling illustration artist on https://eos.atomichub.io/,  
- **Unique creative style**. Because ShuFan's creative style is unique, the creative theme focuses on the close connection between human beings and other life in nature. There are three categories of creative methods: digital painting, pen painting and pen + watercolor combined painting. 
- **ShuFan NFT project is different**. There are some other paintings for sale on EOS, however, ShuFan NFT project is different.
  - *Continuous innovation*. ShuFan is an artist who loves painting, is full of ideals on the symbiotic relationship between man and nature, and is open-minded. She conceives or creates new paintings almost every day.
  - *Explore ahead*. In addition to being the earliest explorer of illustration NFTs on EOS, ShuFan is also constantly exploring new projects on the blockchain and integrating her works into them, including blockchain games, 3D galleries, etc. She is also paying attention to the upcoming outbreak on EOS of ecological projects.
  - *Planned promotion*. The project has received small start-up support from the capital market, and a small team has been formed to promote the project in a planned way. Including the construction of the project [website](https://shufannft.carrd.co/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/ShuFanNFT), [telegram](https://t.me/ShuFanNFT), [discord](https://discord.gg/NkJAnGK9ZA), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shufannft) and other media platforms. ShuFan is also participating in many international illustration competitions.
  - *Long-term strategy*. The ShuFan NFT project wants to make an illustration NFT project with global influence, so it chooses the most potential blockchain project to issue NFT, and EOS ranks first. And plan to build the DAO of the project on EOS at a suitable time in the future.

## Development Status

> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/tree/main/docs/rfps) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the EOS Network Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
