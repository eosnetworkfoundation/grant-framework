- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The illustration NFTs are minted/released on EOS blockchain, including the NFT market of https://eos.atomichub.io, and other potential NFT market on EOS blockchain. 
- **Reason for Interest:** ShuFan NFT project will enrich the artwork NFTs in the EOS ecosystem, demonstrate the excellent performance of EOS in the way of illustration art project application，and attract more traditional artists to join EOS.

### Project Details

- **Background**. NFT, giving traditional painting artists a new platform for displaying and sharing their artworks, is also an epoch-making revolution for the future traditonal painting art market. ShuFan is excited to be in such an era. The excellent performance of EOS also makes it the best public chain for NFT.
- **Development story**. ShuFan is a freelance illustration artist who first release her illustration NFTs on https://eos.atomichub.io/ on March 18, 2021, and sold it in the form of NFT 21 days later, on April 8, the first illustration ["Small Flower" was collected](https://eos.atomichub.io/market/sale/2230) by a collector for 1 EOS ($6.44). Since then, more artworks have been gradually converted into NFTs for the first launch on EOS. And all trade in $EOS.
- **EOS-themed illustrations**. There are 2 EOS-themed illustrations, “[EOS Renaissance](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/template/formynftfans/2907)” and [Eden](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/template/shufan.free/4491), and a related article, [The Creation Story and Interpretation Behind “Eden” NFT](https://shufannft.medium.com/the-creation-story-and-interpretation-behind-eden-nft-9981f4be2fd8), which was [commented](https://twitter.com/EdenCptl/status/1536158075912060928): "One NFT records the most important events in the history of EOS." 
- **Current achievements**. Up to now, the [shufan.free collection](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/shufan.free) has reached 1270 EOS in sales, [**ranking 18th** on the entire network](https://eos.atomichub.io/ranking), and it is also the **only** illustration art collection on the list.
- **EOS ecological project**. The Shufan NFT project is designed to inspire ShuFan to create original illustrations, share and promote them through NFT on EOS, become an important ecological project in the EOS community.  And strive to be an important part of the metaverse.
- **Build a brand**. The current ShuFanNFT project has formed a small team (After discussion by the team, this Level 1 grant plan is applied in the name of ShuFan.), now has its own [official web](https://shufannft.carrd.co/) and other media platforms, committed to building ShuFan NFT as a brand.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **The earliest publishers of artwork NFTs on EOS**. ShuFan is an early explorer in the field of illustration NFTs, one of the earliest publishers of artwork NFTs on EOS, and is currently the highest-selling illustration artist on https://eos.atomichub.io/. 
- **Rare illustrator on EOS**. At present, there are only [90 collections on eos.atomichub.io](https://eos.atomichub.io/explorer#collections), including the 4 collections released by ShuFan, the total number of illustration NFT collections is less than 10. Compared with other public chains such as ETH and Solana, this is very rare. Therefore, ShuFan is the pioneer and stalwart of NFT on EOS, and is currently the most influential illustrator.
- **Will enrich the artwork NFT in the EOS ecosystem**. Artwork NFT is different from the popular game NFT on the market, small circulation (even only 1 Mint), high originality requirements, relatively independent between NFT, relatively high creation cost. In addition, because the illustration artwork itself has an independent collection value, the artwork NFT also has asset value, collection value, appreciation value, aesthetic value, and will increase in value over time. Shufan NFT project will inspire ShuFan to create original illustrations and share them through NFT on EOS, which enrich the artwork NFT in the EOS ecosystem. 
- **Attract more traditional artists**. If ShuFan NFT project is successful on EOS, it will be very beneficial to show the advantages of NFT on EOS (fast, 0 cost, decentralization, user-friendly, etc.), and attract more traditional artists to enter the platform on EOS NFT marketplace.
- **Target audiences**. NFT enthusiasts on EOS and potential illustration art collectors are target audiences.
- **ShuFan NFT project is different**. There are some other painting NFT for sale on EOS, however, ShuFan NFT project is different.
  - **Continuous innovation**. ShuFan is an artist who loves painting, is full of ideals on the symbiotic relationship between man and nature, and is open-minded. She conceives or creates new paintings almost every day.
  - **Unique creative style**. Because ShuFan's creative style is unique, the creative theme focuses on the close connection between human beings and other life in nature. There are three categories of creative methods: digital painting, pen painting and pen + watercolor combined painting. 
  - **Explore ahead**. In addition to being the earliest explorer of illustration NFTs on EOS, ShuFan is also constantly exploring new projects on the blockchain and integrating her works into them, including blockchain games, 3D galleries, etc. She is also paying attention to the upcoming outbreak on EOS of ecological projects.
  - **Long-term strategy**. The ShuFan NFT project wants to make an illustration NFT project with global influence, so it chooses the most potential blockchain project to issue NFT, and EOS ranks first. And plan to build the DAO of the project on EOS at a suitable time in the future.
