## Project Overview

> If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful ENF grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** DaoSwap
- **Brief Description:** DaoSwap is a decentralized project platform that provides EOS users and project teams with various services, such as trading, mining, market making, warehouse locking, wealth management, account registration, CPU purchase, memory purchase, resource free transfer, red envelope sending, anonymous banking, NFT trading, and other functions; Among them, SWAP has added a lockdown function compared to other decentralized exchanges, increasing project stability and user loyalty; Anonymous banks and pomelo red envelopes are their innovative projects. For example, sending red envelopes is an important social behavior among Chinese people, which can effectively improve user activity. The pomelo red envelope is the first red envelope DAPP on pomelo, making efforts to explore the application of EOS and expanding the scope of EOS's smart contracts and NFT applications. It draws on the idea of WeChat red envelopes and implements its functions on the blockchain. Due to the smooth trading status of EOS, the effect of grabbing red envelopes on blockchain is comparable to grabbing red envelopes on WeChat. Our red envelope grabbing technology has wide availability and is currently open source to the community, allowing all DAPPs with red envelope grabbing needs to use this technology for customized red envelope grabbing services. And for anonymous banks, we develop anonymous smart contracts to achieve this goal by adding an additional layer of anonymity and privacy, making user transactions untraceable and achieving the effect of protecting user privacy. Our privacy transfer technology has wide availability, allowing all DAPPs with privacy transfer needs to use this technology for customized privacy services.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** A public facility that provides more services for EOS users and project teams, such as registering accounts, purchasing content, free transfers, sending red envelopes, anonymous transfers, etc., and provides open source services, which will help the EOSIO code resource library.

- **Reason for Interest:** 
It provides more services for EOS users and project teams to gain more revenue and services. It will bring lock-in volume and revenue to the MIXDAO team, while benefiting participants. Ecosystem improvement: attract inactive EOS tokens, which will prosper the ecosystem.




### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOSIO landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
Provide project teams with services such as pomelo red envelopes, anonymous banking, and market mining, without the need for repeated development by the project team. Provide EOS users with pomelo red envelopes, anonymous banking, market mining, account registration, CPU purchase, and resource free transfer services, allowing EOS users to experience multiple EOS interactive experiences in a one-stop manner.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? 
EOS users including any dapp user and project teams

- What need(s) does your project meet?
For generating yield and income when holding EOS

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
There are no similar projects in the EOSIO ecosystem for pomelo red envelopes and anonymous banking services, and these two projects are an innovation; SWAP has similar projects, such as DeFis
  
- If so, how is your project different?
DAOSWAP has functions such as market making lockdown and market making red envelopes, which other platforms do not have

## Our Dream 

Dex, as one of the few blockchain application products that can be implemented, is no longer a problem in terms of technology implementation. However, whether it can bring higher efficiency to users, reduce their usage costs, meet their various needs, and whether it has commercial sustainability will determine its future development. To have lasting vitality, a product must not only conform to the trend of the times, but also have cultural connotations. As one of the products in the blockchain field, DEX must have a certain cultural connotation to connect these users in order to survive and grow in the long term. So behind a well-developed DEX in the future, there will definitely be a strong community and community culture. Economic incentives alone cannot last long. Each DEX must condense its own community culture, which may be a vision, a sentiment, or the origin or continuation of a story. Only with such cultural connotations can it survive and become better and better. We are willing to work hard, we are also willing to give, and we are doing the same! In addition, we are also willing to innovate on EOS, such as pomelo red envelopes, anonymous banks, etc.

### 项目概况
**概述**
- **名称：DaoSwap**

- **简介：** DaoSwap是一个去中心化的项目平台，为EOS用户和项目团队提供多种服务，比如交易、挖矿、做市、锁仓、理财、注册账号、购买CPU、购买内存、免资源转账、发红包、匿名银行、NFT交易等功能；其中SWAP相对其他去中心化交易所增加了锁仓功能，加大项目的稳定性和用户的忠诚度；匿名银行和柚子红包是其创新的项目，比如发红包是中国人社交的重要行为，通过发红包可以有效提高用户活跃度，而柚子红包是柚子上第一个红包DAPP，为EOS的应用探索做出努力，拓展了EOS的智能合约以及NFT应用范围，它借鉴微信红包的思想，把其功能在区块链上进行了一个实现。由于EOS的丝滑交易状态使得在区块链上抢红包的效果媲美在微信上抢红包。我们抢红包技术拥有广泛的可用性，目前已开源给社区，让所有有抢红包需求的dapp 可以利用这个技术进行特制的抢红包服务。而匿名银行，我们开发匿名智能合约，通过加一层额外的匿名性和隐私性来实现这一目标，使得用户交易不可追踪，达到保护用户隐私的效果。我们的隐私转账技术拥有广泛的可用性，让所有有隐私转账需求的dapp 可以利用这个技术进行特制的隐私服务；
- **与EOSIO的关系：** 一种公共设施，为 EOS用户和项目团队提供更多的服务，比如注册账号，购买内容，免费转账，发红包，匿名转账等，并提供开源，这将有助于EOSIO代码资源库。
- **感兴趣的原因：** 它为 EOS 用户和项目团队提供了更多的服务以获得更多收益和服务。它将为 MIXDAO 团队带来锁仓量和收入，同时让参与者受益。生态系统提升：吸引不活跃的EOS代币，这将繁荣生态系统。


### 生态系统
- **您的项目在哪里以及如何融入生态系统？**
-为项目团队提供柚子红包、匿名银行、做市挖矿等服务，不需要项目团队重复开发直接开箱即用，对EOS用户提供柚子红包，匿名银行、做市挖矿、做市锁仓、注册账号、购买CPU、购买内存、免资源转账等服务，让EOS用户一站式体验多种EOS交互体验。

- **谁是你的目标受众（链/dapp/钱包/UI 开发人员、设计师、你自己的用户群、一些 dapp 的用户群、你自己）？**

### 我们的梦想

Dex作为目前少数能落地的区块链应用产品，在技术实现上已不成问题，但能否为用户带来更高的效率，能否降低用户的使用成本，满足用户的各方面需求，以及是否有商业上的可持续性将决定其未来的发展。一个产品要想有持久的生命力，除了顺应时代发展的大势外，其本身一定要有文化内涵。DEX作为区块链领域的产品之一，要想长久生存并发展壮大，我想它一定也得有一定的文化内涵将这些用户联系在一起。所以未来发展得好的DEX背后一定会有一个强大的社区以及社区文化，光凭经济利益的激励势必不能长久，每个DEX都要凝聚出自己的社区文化，它可能是一种远景，可能是一种情怀，又或者是一个故事的源起或待续，只有有了这样的文化内涵才能一直存活下去，并越来越好。我们愿意努力，我们也愿意付出，我们也正在这么做！除此之外我们也愿意在EOS做一些创新比如柚子红包，匿名银行等。
