## Project Overview

### Overview


- **Name:** EOS Spanish Courses
- **Brief Description:** Theoretical and practical courses on EOS blockchain in Spanish for the people of Latin America.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into EOSIO.
- **Reason for Interest:** Being able to teach crypto-enthusiasts and developers from Latin America to work with the EOS blockchain for all kinds of applications. 

### Project Details

This project consists of the creation of 2 courses:
1. An introductory course on Blockchain from an EOS perspective and teach all the components and architecture of EOS, including sample source code in a repository on github.
2. A practical course, which teaches about the creation of a decentralized application, focused on people learning how they can develop their own projects.
3. Carrying out 2 meetups (one introductory and the other technical), for the Latin community and that can clarify doubts, and encourage them to use EOS in their own projects for the web3.

### Ecosystem Fit

This project and its courses are designed to massify EOS in the Latin community, which is growing strongly in the use and creation of blockchain and web3 technologies, but who have not been able to easily access content because they do not understand English well, and the few courses in Spanish, they are with Ethereum and other blockchains, but very outdated.
We have not found EOS content in Spanish teaching all the basics of the technology (we do see news in Spanish, but not how to work with it).

## Future Plans

- The intention is to use social networks to promote it, both on Twitter and LinkedIn, where I am very active and a benchmark in the region on technology issues.
- In the future, the idea is to form a community of blockchain programmers and leaders in the region to create content and support each other.
- Also, integrating EOS into the projects I'm working on at my new company, [Techgethr](https://techgethr.com/), which is a product hub for Web3.
