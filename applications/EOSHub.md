## Project Overview
Our team has already successfully created and launched an EOS ecosystem dashboard in collaboration with Kolektivo Labs and Hypha DAO, which is live and provides a detailed and easy-to-navigate overview of 10+ different EOS & EOS EVM projects. 

After the successful development of the EOS ecosystem dashboard and Pomelo grant participation - we intend to expand the Dashboard into a full fledge EOS Hub. The EOS Ecosystem hub is a standalone platform with it’s own brand and socials that will provide a deepdive on all projects on EOS and EOS EVM, create ecosystem reports and EOS guides.  The EOS Hub will provide all EOS stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem projects status and quality. Which helps with curation, grant allocation, partnerships and exploration. 

The EOS hub is free to use and projects reviewed do not have to pay a fee of any kind. EOS native analysts can get involved to help create reports that will shape up the hub - this not only enhances the quality of the hub but also helps EOS native contributors grow. EOS native analysts will be rewarded once a report has been reviewed.  All insights will be put together in an EOS Ecosystem Report - an easy-to-digest and highly visual report that can be utilized by existing and potential EOS ecosystem members to get a snapshot of all initiatives and potential of the EOS Network. This comprehensive approach will ensure that we continue to provide valuable resources for the EOS ecosystem. 

An extensive DeFi and DAO infrastructure map which will highlight existing tools and ecosystem initiatives, and identify missing pieces which can help prioritize EOS Ecosystem development.
An overview of the top  EOS native projects - This will help existing and potential EOS ecosystem members to better understand project quality to guide their contributions.


Looking ahead, we see great potential in establishing an EOS DAO Ecosystem Acceleration program that will leverage our collective network, services, and technology to greatly accelerate DAO and DeFi growth on EOS. Our project will focus on creating the ecosystem insights required to run an effective acceleration program and prioritize product deployment.

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOS Network landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
