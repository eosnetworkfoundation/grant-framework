## Project Overview



### Overview


- **Name:** EOS Hub 
- **Brief Description:** The EOS Hub is a platform designed to enhance the EOS ecosystem by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for EOS and EOS EVM projects.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** The EOS Hub will provide all EOS stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem projects' status and quality. EOS Hub will foster community engagement, streamline EOS ecosystem insights, and offer tools to accelerate DAO and DeFi growth on EOS. 
- **Reason for Interest:** As the EOS ecosystem grows, there's a need for a unified platform where projects, developers, and stakeholders can come together. The EOS Hub aims to be that central point of reference, providing a comprehensive overview of EOS projects, tools, and initiatives.

### Project Details

Our team has already successfully created and launched an EOS ecosystem dashboard in collaboration with Kolektivo Labs and Hypha DAO, which is live and provides a detailed and easy-to-navigate overview of 10+ different EOS & EOS EVM projects. 

After the successful development of the EOS ecosystem dashboard and Pomelo grant participation - we intend to expand the Dashboard into a full fledge EOS Hub. The EOS Ecosystem hub is a standalone platform with itâ€™s own brand and socials that will provide a deepdive on all projects on EOS and EOS EVM, create ecosystem reports and EOS guides.  The EOS Hub will provide all EOS stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem projects status and quality. Which helps with curation, grant allocation, partnerships and exploration. 

The EOS hub is free to use and projects reviewed do not have to pay a fee of any kind. EOS native analysts can get involved to help create reports that will shape up the hub - this not only enhances the quality of the hub but also helps EOS native contributors grow. EOS native analysts will be rewarded once a report has been reviewed.  All insights will be put together in an EOS Ecosystem Report - an easy-to-digest and highly visual report that can be utilized by existing and potential EOS ecosystem members to get a snapshot of all initiatives and potential of the EOS Network. This comprehensive approach will ensure we continue providing valuable resources for the EOS ecosystem. 

An extensive DeFi and DAO infrastructure map which will highlight existing tools and ecosystem initiatives, and identify missing pieces which can help prioritize EOS Ecosystem development.
An overview of the top  EOS native projects - This will help existing and potential EOS ecosystem members to better understand project quality to guide their contributions.

Eos Hub will also be providing a detailed and easy-to-navigate overview of different EOS & EOS EVM projects. It's designed to improve ecosystem growth and coordination. The Hub API will provide easy and reliable access to all EOS data, including project Ratings and sub-category scores. 

Looking ahead, we see great potential in establishing an EOS DAO Ecosystem Acceleration program that will leverage our collective network, services, and technology to accelerate DAO and DeFi growth on EOS greatly. Our project will focus on creating the ecosystem insights required to run an effective acceleration program and prioritize product deployment.


### Ecosystem Fit

Our primary target audience includes EOS blockchain developers, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), dApp developers, EOS wallet users, and participants within the EOS ecosystem. 

Our project serves to address several essential needs within the EOS DAO Ecosystem:

**Ecosystem Mapping**: By creating a comprehensive ecosystem assessment, we aim to provide a clear, detailed map of the EOS DAO Ecosystem. This would be beneficial to all participants in the ecosystem, helping them better understand the environment and identify opportunities and challenges.

**Guided Resource Allocation**: The Ecosystem Report will serve as a critical foundation for directing EOS Network resources more effectively. This can help maximize the impact of these resources, promoting growth and innovation within the EOS DAO Ecosystem.

**Enhanced Understanding**: This project will enhance the understanding of the DAO landscape on the EOS network, supporting its development and maturity. This knowledge could be instrumental for new and existing DAOs, developers, users, and other stakeholders.

There are no direct equivalents to the EOS hub within the EOS and Antelope ecosystem. This makes the project unique and potentially very valuable to the EOS community, as it provides a comprehensive overview of EOS & EOS EVM projects in a way that no other project currently does. The EOS hub shares similarities with a few projects in the broader crypto ecosystem. Baserank is a crowdsourced platform that evaluates the risk of crypto assets based on ratings from various sources. Lastly, Messari is a data aggregator that provides information and ratings on various cryptocurrencies based on their fundamental and technical aspects.

## Development Roadmap


### Milestone Summary


- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 35,000 USD

Over the course of 4 months, with the dedicated effort of 3 full-time equivalents (FTEs), and a total budget of 35,000 USD, we plan to accomplish significant milestones that will enhance the EOS ecosystem. We will kick off our project by building upon our existing work where we have already assessed 15 projects on EOS using our proven methodology, these can be seen here. This forms the foundation of our first milestone, where we will develop a comprehensive DeFi and DAO infrastructure map for the EOS ecosystem. This map will highlight existing tools and initiatives and identify gaps that can inform future EOS Ecosystem spending.

Moving into the second milestone, we will enhance the EOS Dashboard by adding new features and improving its user interface. We will also expand the scope of the dashboard by adding new EOS and EOS EVM projects. In the third milestone, we will host an EOS Rate-a-thon, a community initiative that rewards participants for their contributions.

Finally, in the fourth milestone, we will consolidate all the insights gathered over the course of the project into a comprehensive yet easy-to-digest EOS Ecosystem Report. This highly visual report will serve as a valuable tool for both existing and potential EOS ecosystem members, providing a snapshot of all initiatives and the untapped potential of the EOS Network. Through these milestones, we aim to significantly enhance the EOS ecosystem by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for EOS and EOS EVM projects, fostering community engagement, and delivering a valuable EOS Ecosystem Report.
