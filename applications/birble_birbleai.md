Overview

    Please provide the following:

    Name: If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line AI driven advertising token system
    Brief Description: Birble is an innovative advertising token that seeks to bring together crypto projects to maximize their spending and customer 
    reach while being the driving force of marketing crypto projects to the rest of the world. With the ADD Model, we aim to ensure the cooperation of 
    many projects through the money they will save while obtaining their social out-reach goals. Our mission is to organize viable crypto projects into an 
    advertising conglomerate whose funds are pooled into our advertising funds in order to spend them in the most effective manner with us using all mediums 
    available and guided by artificial intelligence. We believe that Birble will pave the way for a new era of advertising through artificial intelligence and 
    analytic review that will ultimately prove to be the best marketing tool while ensuring the best use of time and money spent for the clients and partners 
    involved.
    Relationship to EOS Network /none yet, just big fans of the ecosystem and want to build ai & web3 products on EOS blockchain
    Reason for Interest: Birble AI would be interested in building on the EOS blockchain because it offers a high level of scalability, 
    security, and flexibility. The EOS blockchain is designed to handle millions of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications 
    that require high throughput. Additionally, the EOS blockchain is built with a robust security model that ensures data integrity and privacy. 
    Finally, the EOS blockchain provides developers with a wide range of tools and features that make it easy to build custom applications. 
    All of these features make the EOS blockchain an attractive platform for Birble AI to build on.

Development Status

 Development has yet begun. However, the Birble AI team for nearly 5 years has been researching and building the core Web3 & AI components required
 for a comprehensive framework of web client SDKs. Many of the components for this new project can lean heavily on this work as the ecosystem moves 
 to create a new suite of official products that can ease adoption by EOSIO developers to use our AI advertising model.

All of the following components played a role in the lead up to the path forward with this proposal.

Providing the world with passive income through our advanced AI advertising model.
Our revenue model is straightforward and effective. We do not charge fees for any of the products or services we offer, instead relying on our innovative advertising model to generate revenue. Vendors must purchase “Add Blocks” with the Birble token, creating buy pressure on the open market and allowing token holders to benefit from this activity. We have many working products in our portfolio and many on test net and sandbox environment almost ready for main net, check our services page.
Add Model
The ADD Model of Birble is a comprehensive approach to advertising that utilizes the Birble token to purchase add space on our sites and partner sites, as well as join any social media campaigns. As we expand our reach to other platforms and develop relationships with agencies and influencers, these services will only be available for purchase with the Birble token. To maximize the effectiveness of a client’s money and ensure their message is delivered, we are utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms to determine the best use of resources. We are also developing our own Birble Artificial Intelligence Aggregator to refine results and guide marketing campaigns. Until this is implemented, we will use a cooperative structure for clients and partners to spread out the cost of campaigns across various crypto projects while delivering their intended message. This approach will reduce time spent and money wasted on misguided marketing efforts.
For example, a potential client could purchase ad space on our sites and partner sites with the Birble token. They could also join any social media campaigns that we are running. Our AI algorithms will be used to determine the best use of resources for their campaign, and our AI Aggregator will refine results and guide their marketing efforts. Finally, they can take advantage of our cooperative structure to spread out the cost of their campaign across various along with other crypto projects while still delivering their intended message.

Key Advantages
-Advertise quickly and change add or campaign as needed to suite the projects individual needs.
-Advertise within the ecosystem your project is being used and with other projects to create synergy.
-Projects with a smaller budget will finally be able to take part in larger campaigns for a longer period of time.
-Cross promotion between a larger group of participants with custom made conglomerate ads in the same particular sect or niche or even a niche complimenting one another and therefor maximizing a customer’s time spent viewing adds.
-Be part of a larger ad pool on a limited budget but still allowing you to reach the desired audience with no contract obligated time line.

Easily Reach High-intent, High-value Audiences with Predictions Our prediction templates powered by smart machine learning algorithms will help you create intelligent and highly targeted campaigns, so projects and clients can reach the right audience at the right time on the channel that’s preferred by them.
Built-in Analytics and Customer Journey Insights, truly insightful and impactful personalization can only be achieved when customer behavior is understood and anticipated. The Birble AI Aggregator personalization is pre-built with advanced customer journey analytics that visualize and quickly target the right segments, so you’re never wasting money.
Streamlines marketing efforts with Deep learning through Artificial Intelligence allows us to more accurately identify user behavior and predict which segments are more likely to become customers. Programs can provide specific information related to which leads will probably convert, allowing marketers to target their efforts based on detailed demographics – without wasting time on less probable leads again saving money and time.
