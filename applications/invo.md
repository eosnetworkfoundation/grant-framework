## Project Overview

Our project is to develop and implement Invo technology, a solution for the problem of games losing a large percentage of their player base within a short period of time. Invo technology transforms virtual economies into real economies with value that can be adjusted for inflation, enabling virtual economies to function more like real economies. This has the potential to benefit both users and game developers and publishers, who can generate additional revenue through fees collected when players transfer their value or cash among different virtual economies. 

### Overview

- **Name:** Creating A Better Digital Economy
- **Brief Description:** The main objective of Invo is to create value for its users and partners by providing a technology that enables virtual economies to function more like real economies, while also generating revenue for the company. Our project aims to become the leading provider of technology for transforming virtual economies into real economies with value, partner with a wide variety of game developers and publishers to integrate the Invo technology into their games and metaverses, build a large and active user base of gamers and metaverse players who are able to transfer their value or cash among different virtual economies using the Invo technology, and continuously improve and update the Invo technology to stay ahead of competitors and meet the needs of its users.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Invo's interoperability feature can bring significant benefits to the EOS network. With Invo, EOS users can access and utilize services and assets from other blockchain networks, opening up new possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps) and the entire EOS ecosystem. This interoperability can also attract users from other networks to EOS, increasing the network's user base and transaction volume. Additionally, the ability to interact with other networks can increase the utility and adoption of EOS-based tokens.

Furthermore, Invo's technology can enhance the scalability and efficiency of the EOS network. Invo can further split transactions into smaller pieces and process them, improving transaction throughput and reducing latency. This can greatly improve the user experience on the EOS network, making it more appealing to developers and end-users alike. Invo's technology can also reduce the cost of using EOS network resources, making it more accessible to a wider range of users and applications.
- **Reason for Interest:** Here are a few reasons why Invo may be interested in the EOS Network:

- Scalability: The EOS Network is designed to handle a large number of transactions per second, making it an ideal platform for high-volume use cases.

- Interoperability: The EOS Network has a strong focus on interoperability, making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications that can communicate with other blockchain networks.

- Community: The EOS community is one of the largest and most active in the blockchain space, making it an attractive platform for developers looking to build and grow their user base.

- Smart Contract Functionality: The EOS Network has a robust smart contract functionality that allows developers to create sophisticated decentralized applications.

- Cost-Effective: The EOS Network's PowerUp Model enables developers to provide resources to their users at a low cost, making it an ideal platform for building applications with large user bases.

### Project Details

- The project involves developing and implementing Invo technology on the EOS    blockchain for transaction speed and security.
- Invo technology will include a 1% fee on transfers by gamers and a separate 1% buy and sell tax on all transactions on exchanges, going directly to Invo's company wallet as revenue.
- Invo will do a hard fork on the Uniswap V3 AMM to ensure liquidity will always be available to all virtual economies that use the Invo technology.
- The project will provide an eCommerce platform that allows gamers and metaverse players to exit their value and purchase tangible products to be shipped to their homes.
- Invo will adhere to industry standards for compliance and security when operating the eCommerce platform.
- Transfers between games will have a 10% tax, with 60% split equally between developers of the games and the other 40% going to Invo as revenue.
- The interoperability of different virtual economies created by the Invo technology allows players to continue using their value or cash within a variety of games or metaverses.
- The project will focus on delivering low-cost, high value, IP protected smart contracts and AMM, ecommerce solution, game engine SDK, and mobile apps for IOS and Android.
- The project aims to establish strong partnerships with game developers and publishers to expand the user base and increase the reach of the technology.
- The project aims to continuously improve and update the Invo technology to meet the needs of users and stay ahead of competitors.
- The project aims to build strong brand awareness and effectively market the Invo technology to attract users and partners.
- The project aims to generate additional revenue for users, game developers, and publishers by transforming virtual economies into real economies with value.

### Ecosystem Fit

- The Invo project aims to provide interoperability between different blockchain networks, including the EOS network. Invo will act as a bridge between EOS and other blockchains, allowing users to easily transfer assets and data between different networks.
- The target audience for Invo includes gamers, game developers, metaverse developers, and game publishers. Invo's interoperability solutions will benefit both individual gamers and busindevelopersesses who require seamless value transfers between different games, and blockchain networks.
- Invo's main goal is to solve the issue of game economy interoperability, which has been a major challenge for the industry. By providing an easy-to-use bridge between different networks, Invo will allow gamers to access a wider range of blockchain-based applications and services, without the need for complex technical knowledge or additional infrastructure.
- There are other projects in the EOS network that provide interoperability solutions, such as EOSIO's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). However, Invo differentiates itself by offering a user-friendly and customizable solution that can be integrated with web2 and web3 games.
