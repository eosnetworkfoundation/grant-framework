## Project Overview

Clout Finance is a decentralized spot and perpetual exchange that supports low swap fees and zero price impact trades. Trading is supported by a unique multi-asset pool that earns liquidity providers fees from market making, swap fees and leverage trading.

The Fees earned from the DEX, will be distributed to the Stakers, Liquidity provider and buy-back to deepen the liquidity



### Overview

- **Name:** Clout Finance, a Perpetual Decentralized Exchange
- **Brief Description:** Clout Finance is a decentralised spot and perpetual exchnage that will allow the users to take long and short call of assets like BTC, ETH, EOS, and more.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Clout Finance Brings the Perpetuals to the EOS ecosystem allowing users to take long and short position directly from their metamask
- **Reason for Interest:** EOS EVM is a growing Ecosystem and Clout wants to be the part of the adaptation from the very start, the fast transactions that can be performed on EOS EVM is also one reason we are excited to build the application on EOS

### Project Details

**Clout Finance** offers following features: 
- Decentralised spot and Perpetual exchange allowing users to take short and long position directly from their non-custodial wallets
- Add Liquidity to the platform by minting CLP tokens in exchange of supported basket assets like ETH, BTC, EOS, USDT and more
- Remove Liquidity and get your assets back by burning the CLP 
- Staking the CLOUT and CLP tokens for rewards

***Fees Distribution***

   **60%** fees for CLP Stakers
    **30%** fees for CLOUT & esCLOUT Stakers
    **5%** fees for the dev team
    **5%** fees for  buyback and CLOUT-EOS LP

***CLP, platform's liquidity provider token***

CLP consists of an index of assets used for swaps and leverage trading. It can be minted using any index asset and burnt to redeem any index asset. The price for minting and redemption is calculated based on (the total worth of assets in the index including profits and losses of open positions) / (CLP supply).

Holders of the CLP token earn Escrowed CLOUT rewards and 60% of platform fees distributed in EOS.

***Rewards***

CLOUT Rewards provide benefits for long-term users of the protocol, these rewards come in the form of Escrowed CLOUT and Multiplier Points.

A summary of rewards and mechanics:

   **CLOUT**: earns **EOS / WETH**, **esCLOUT**, and **Multiplier Points** when staked
    **esCLOUT**: earns **EOS / WETH**, **esCLOUT**, and **Multiplier Points** when staked
    **Multiplier Points**: **boost EOS / WETH APRs** when staked
     **CLP**: earns **EOS / WETH**, **esCLOUT**, automatically staked on mint


### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 

	Currently there is no Perpetual DEX on EOS EVM, that's where we come in, we can bring in new liquidity(TVL) and asset exposure with the CLP index token offerings and with our exciting fee distribution, we can attract new users.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? 

	Chains: By adding support of the respective native asset in our liquidity token CLP we would attarct users from ETH, BTC, MATIC, AVAX
	Dapps: By collaboration of major DEXes in the EOS ecosystem we leverage the existing dapp community of EOS
	Wallet: By collaboration with wallets like OKX, Bitkeep and more, we get exposure from their community
	
- What need(s) does your project meet? 

	Decentralised Perpetual trading is today’s need in any and every ecosystem, users must be able to take long and short positions without compromising their control of the asset
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem? 

	At the moment, we don't see any other project in the ecosystem and yes there are similar projects in related ecosystem
