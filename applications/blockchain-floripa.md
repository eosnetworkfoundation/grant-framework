## Project Overview

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** Blockchain Floripa - Where blockchain meets pearly beaches.
- **Brief Description:** Creating large in-person EOS events and weekly meetups to help advertise, educate and grow the community. 
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We have been highlighting EOS projects (Such as Animal Concerts and Upland) and want to continue to do so whilst promoting EOS and other projects built upon it.
- **Reason for Interest:** We began with two separate large events and have been hosting in-person weekly meetups for over 1 year now to talk about the cryptocurrency community.
Our meetups and events have highlighted EOS projects and sister-chains and we are creating these events because of our love for the community. However, we aren't able to break-even at the moment when creating these events and meetups and therefore are requesting support from the EOS community.

### Project Details

We would love to start by updating you on the electrifying success of our last event, in which we introduced EOS, Pomelo and the EOS Network Foundation to the public.

The blockchain festival was so engaging that it was featured on Beincrypto’s social media accounts and videos shared by exciting companies, such as Animal Concerts; who work with bringing A-listers such as Snoop Dogg and Billy Ray Cyrus to the blockchain space. (Check out the video here - https://www.instagram.com/p/CmPEYZaA_q_/)

Rather than stop and smell the roses, we want to build upon the momentum and create exciting content and form a vibrant community around EOS.

We’re excited to announce that our next event will be a boat party, featuring not only EOS but other sister chains such as Telos, WAX and FIO where my co-organiser works.

We are glad to confirm that Animal Concerts will be joining again, as they look to launch a super exciting project on EOS. We feel Animal Concers showcases the importance of large, exciting events when it comes to introducing EOS to the masses.

We will also be organising weekly EOS meetups, because as you know, in-person events are an essential part of promoting EOS and creating a strong and vibrant community.

In-person events bring people together in a way which can't be replicated online to share experiences, ideas and provide an opportunity for people to create meaningful connections with each other; creating lasting relationships and networks that are vital for a thriving community.

Regular events also provide an opportunity for people to learn about EOS and the ecosystem, as well as a place for people to exchange knowledge and skills.

These events can be expensive to both host and maintain. The videographers, editors, photographers, marketing costs, weekly venue for the meetup and more all add up.

This is why we are seeking funding, not only for the weekly meet-ups, but also for the EOS Boat Festival. We believe both the event and after video will bring a lot of attention to EOS and build excitement around the community.

Brazil is one of the fastest growing countries when it comes to crypto adoption (See: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/75-brazil-34-5-million-153332274.html)
And our island “Floripa” is the powerhouse of Blockchain in the country, often referred to as the Silicon Island. (See: https://brazilian.report/tech/2019/08/23/tech-roundup-brazil-silicon-valley/)

We aim to be for EOS, what Bitcoin Beach is in El Salvador for Bitcoin.

I hope you can help us make this dream a reality, we already have a base-community to build upon and the reality is; raising funds for a fun, educational program is an essential part of continuing to grow our community.


### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Our project is an important part of building the EOS community, providing education to those learning about EOS and crypto and providing a safe and fun space for those in the community to exchange ideas and help innovation grow.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? Our intended audience is all people traveling to, passing by or living in Florianopolis who have an interest in crypto. Ideally we want to create a hub for the EOS community.
- What need(s) does your project meet? We create in-person events, providing a tangible aspect to the EOS community and visible proof of a thriving and growing ecosystem.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? Yes, there are online events made by Animal Concerts and also commmunity building projects on Pomelo.
  - If so, how is your project different? We arrange in-person events, parties, workshops and educational meetings as well as weekly meetups, to help grow the community organically.
