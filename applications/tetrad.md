## Project Overview


### Overview


- **Name:** Tetrad Protocol
- **Brief Description:** We make DeFi safer and easier to access by offering a DeFi as a service protocol, operated by a TEam of TRADers who developed a community owned tokenized treasury. Our mission is to fulfill the promise of decentralized finance, stable and steady yield for liquidity providers.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Chris Barnes + See Ecosystem Fit
- **Reason for Interest:** Belief in Trust EVM & Recovery

### Project Details


- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components: https://tetrad.finance
- Data models of the core functionality: N/A
- API specifications of the core functionality: We have an ABI of our contracts, and we connect to the DeBank API, but otherwise we do not have an API of our own. See the ABI here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG0tcDO-_wQvlyAMEpQ8ClCMvOWNQA9nTmA9Ft5Id4s/edit?usp=sharing
- An overview of the technology stack to be used: Solidity (Contracts) + React (Frontend)
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed: Solidity + Polygon + EOS (EVM Chains)
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic: MVP: Testnet Contracts and Website (https://defi-paradise.github.io/digitopia-frontend/); Our token interacts well with Quickswap.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement: We will not participate in narratives that have failed liquidity providers such as the company borrowing/using leverage or algorithmic stable coin yield opportunities.

### Ecosystem Fit


- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?: Our team will lock up liquidity and responsibly invest it throughout the EOS ecosystem, creating capital velocity and price appreciation.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?: Our target audience is retail and Web3 liquidity providers, traders, and institutions.
- What need(s) does your project meet?: We meet the need for liquidity providers to safely access yield mechanisms without paying their tuition to the blockchain.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?: Currently we are not familiar with another DAAS team on EOS. There are some similar contracts on Scary Chain Capital on Fantom.

```
Hey Alex,
 
It was great to speak today and I'm quite excited to be able to assist you with your project and deploying it onto EOS.

The two bits that I owed are as follows:
EOS grant framework answer sheet template. Feel free to make a copy of that to then assist with filling out the Github submission form.
In order to register for a future Helios Incubator session please go here and fill out the Founder section.
Please let me know if you have any questions and I look forward to helping you as best I can with your project. I'll be in touch once I know more about the upcoming hackathons also so you can be sure to apply to those once they are live.

For the grant framework there is one requirement for the up to $50k amount to have done a Pomelo pitch. It's likely too late to catch the current season of Pomelo (which is a public good funding platform on EOS) but I can certainly give you a hand with future seasons if needed...which are quarterly.

Thanks,
--

## Future Plans


- How you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term: We intend to build investment products on our dapp, such as algorithmic coded strategies for USDT pairs, staking pools for EOS, USDT and other stable coin and blue chip crypto assets, as well as algorithmic delta neutral strategies. 
- The team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it: In the long term, a robust suite of investment products for our community.


## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Alex Pearson did personal research and discovered Trust EVM, Recovery+ and Yield+ and we dedicated a portion of our crypto portfolio to EOS.  We reached out to several EOS members and came into contact with Chris Barnes personally.  He explained the program and how to apply.


- Work you have already done: We have created working code and launched on Mumbai testnet with functioning UI / UX capabilites. Our token interacts with DEX and LP pools and our first staking pool and treasury are all coded and operational.
- If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project: The project has been bootstrapped by the core team, no outside investment has been accepted at this time.
- Previous grants you may have applied for: N/A
