## Project Overview
We're creating a TypeScript library for the Antelope IBC, to be distributed as an npm package. It will feature a user-friendly API, strong type safety, high performance, and comprehensive documentation.

### Overview

- **Name:**  IBC TypeScript Library
- **Brief Description:**  Lower the barrier to entry for projects that want to implement IBC.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:**  Part of core functionality.
- **Reason for Interest:**  We had a huge issue with implementing the JavaScript code.

### Project Details
The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive rewrite of the existing JavaScript code base that underpins the Cryptomechanics-developed Antelope Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) system. Our focus is to enhance the developer experience and simplify the process of building complex applications that utilize IBC. This library, which can be employed in both frontend and backend development, will be using Wharf SDK, funded by the Antelope coalition, replacing the use of the eosjs library. By streamlining the codebase, we aim to remove barriers to entry for developers, fostering an environment of greater innovation and collaboration. Ultimately, our goal is to propel broader adoption and usage of the Antelope IBC system.

### Ecosystem Fit
This library will become a cornerstone tool in the Antelope ecosystem. By lowering the barrier of entry to the Antelope IBC, we aim to attract more developers and foster innovation within the Antelope ecosystem.

## Development Status
In developement


## Development Roadmap
Creation of NPM Antelope IBC package
Documentation

### Milestone â€” Implementation of the NPM package

- **Estimated duration:** 3 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 30,000 USD

Design, development, and implementation of the TypeScript library as an npm package. Our team will build a robust and user-friendly API for Antelope IBC, ensuring the code is clear, maintainable, and efficient. We will also write comprehensive documentation to make it easy for other developers to use the library.

## Future Plans

Upon the successful completion of this project, we plan to continue refining and expanding the library based on user feedback and changes in the Antelope IBC system. Our aim is to establish the library as a staple in the Antelope development toolkit. Furthermore, we hope to use this project as a stepping stone to create more tools and libraries that enhance the accessibility and usability of blockchain technologies.
