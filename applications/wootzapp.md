# EOS Network Foundation Grant Proposal

-   **Project Name:** WootzApp
-   **Team Name:** WootzApp.com
-   **EOS Payment Address:** wootzappcom.gm
-   **[Level](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework#grant-levels):** 3

## Project Overview
Onboarding the next billion users to Blockchain. Are you going to ask them to use a desktop browser extension ? Most people dont have a desktop - especially in Asia. Their only device of accessing the internet is their mobile phone. That's why you need a web browser build ground up for crypto (and which implements all of the browser specific EIP). The user does not need a wallet app and a browser app separately.

All of these tools will be written in Flutter (for ios+android compatibility). The framework will be architected to be easy for developers and users.

### Overview

-   **Name:** WootzApp
-   **Brief Description:** Create a new, free, open-source mobile-first web browser with an integrated wallet. Especially for the next billion users.
-   **Relationship to EOSIO:** EOSIO will become massively more usable on the mobile phone web using Wootzapp
-   **Reason for Interest:** WootzApp devs has been focusing on the evolution of EOSIO especially due to their core focus on wallets/DAO onboarding. EOSIO team has not only innovated at the protocol level, but done the painstaking work to build multiple SDKs on multiple different programming languages. Our philosophy towards onramp aligns with EOSIO.

### Project Details
 

-   **A. WootzApp Core Mobile Web Browser Source Code:** https://github.com/wootzapp/wootz-browser.
-   **B. WootzApp Android app release:** [https://github.com/wootzapp/wootz-browser.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wootzapp.browser)
-   **C. WootzApp Design Assets:** [Figma assets](https://www.figma.com/file/ZiV1e5dTxNU20so3foISK7/wootzapp). We are fundamentally innovating on how a user comes on board for the first time to web3. We want EOSIO to be one of the first blockchains that a user ever touches for the first time in their life. And we are mobile-first. This requires a completely new way to think about design and we are innovating here. here are more screens on a radical rethink of browsers - https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1598380478029266944 and https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1599108929711378432

-   **F. Brand Identity:** Brand design to create a recognizable identity for users in the alternative web browser space. This will include fundamental communication and designs assets (for the promotional and educational materials). A website and/or Youtube channel "How to get on web3 for the first time using EOS as your gateway"
