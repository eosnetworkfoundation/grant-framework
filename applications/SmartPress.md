**Contact Email:** [contact@smartpress.ai](mailto:contact@smartpress.ai)  
**Blockchain Platform:** EOS_EVM, ETH  
**Grant Type:** Infrastructure Grant and Community Building Grant

## Project Overview and Ecosystem Fit

SmartPress's goal has always been to make creating your own smart contracts achievable for anyone. However, most developers face struggles in getting started with smart contract development and bringing their visions to life.

Born out of the EOS global hackathon in 2018, SmartPress envisions an easy-to-use smart contract building platform powered by AI. It simplifies contract writing, compilation, deployment to EOS_EVM, and verification processes—making smart contract development a breeze.

The vision is to empower users to express their ideas and receive tangible results effortlessly, similar to Remix but without the complexity.

The goal is to onboard thousands of new developers to the EOS developer ecosystem by providing a user-friendly platform for prototyping and deploying ideas. SmartPress streamlines EOS development, with EOS_EVM network forefront in our wallet's network selector. Additionally, we assist users in setting up wallets and provide guides on obtaining testnet faucet tokens specifically for EOS.

To illustrate SmartPress's capabilities, we asked it to create a smart contract for this grant process. You can find the results at [this link](https://www.smartpress.ai/create/ai/results/e0ed18b5-a3dc-42a9-88d4-afd8d064f805) and verified on EOS_EVM testnet [here](https://explorer.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com/address/0x425974edf0381bd2bF6a18412c3D8553280A07a8/contracts#address-tabs).

Prompt: "Create a system that manages grant applications for funding, where applications fall into three tiers of funding: 10,000 USD, 50,000 USD, and 200,000 USD. Users should propose their projects and upload a link to the git commit of their project proposal. Specified voters set up in the contract can vote on the proposal, with 2 votes required for a 10,000 USD proposal, 3 votes for 50,000 USD, and four votes for 200,000 USD."

## Team

**Team Name:** SmartPress  
**Team Members:** Lachlan Greenbank (Founder and lead engineer)  

Lachlan lead the engineering team that built the first globally regulated and fully backed stock exchange on Ethereum, SOMA.finance, expected to launch in 2023.

He won the EOSIO global hackathon in Sydney in 2018 and has been building smart contracts since 2016, experiencing the pain points and pitfalls firsthand.

## Development Status

Development of the platform rebuild started in early June 2023. We've made significant progress and released a public version at [smartpress.ai](https://smartpress.ai). Key components developed include:

- Core AI code writing services
- Compiling and flattening services
- Prompting engines
- Security measures
- Integration with popular libraries like OpenZeppelin and Chainlink
- Browser-based deployment supporting 100s of wallets
- Code result sharing

We've already built and deployed hundreds of contracts and received valuable feedback from the EOS community.

## Development Roadmap and Milestones

We have several exciting features in the works:

- Support for bringing your own contract and adding new features to it
- Local dev chains for developers to deploy locally
- Assistance in plugging creations into applications by writing custom plugins
- Specific prompting templates for various application types
- Support for more smart contract libraries in code generations
- AI function re-architecture for improved code generations
- Ongoing maintenance to ensure a seamless platform experience
- Private instances for teams to build securely
- Increased security in creations with additional code for protecting sensitive functions
- Onboarding more users to EOS by attending hackathons and EVM-related events

We'll work through as many of these milestones as possible during the grant period.

## Future Plans

Our vision is to onboard a million new smart contract developers to EOS. We aim for SmartPress to be responsible for half of all EVM contracts deployed in the future, streamlining the smart contract development process. The platform will evolve into more than just a smart contract builder, encompassing user interfaces, websites, and apps—essentially building entire project templates from a single prompt.

## Budget

**Total Budget:** $50,000 USD

- **Development Costs and Full-Time Work**: $39,000 USD
- **User Onboarding Initiatives**: $10,000 USD (events, developer competitions, sponsorships)
- **Hosting and AI Costs**: $1,000 USD

- This budget will give us 6 months of fuel to build with full focus.

## Reporting and Accountability

We commit to providing fortnightly reports on progress during the grant period. The reports will include:

- Features developed and shipped
- Users onboarded
- Challenges overcome
- Marketing updates
- Fund utilization details

Additionally, we'll provide a comprehensive summary report at the end of the grant period, showcasing all achievements.
