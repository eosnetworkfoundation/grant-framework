# EOS Network Foundation Grant Proposal

- **Project Name: EOSTARTER**
- **Team Name: Eostarter Ltd.** 
- **EOS Payment Address: eostartereos** 
- **Level: 3**

## Project Overview

EOSTARTER is a community-powered Incubator for new projects building on EOS. We are building a Gamified Launchpad Platform where investors can participate in early-stage projects and be part of their success. As part of our business model, we launch Token Presales and NFT Drops for teams and companies that build their products on EOSIO.

### Overview

- **Name:** EOSTARTER TokenSale Platform 

- **Brief Description:** We are proposing to develop a Token Sale Smart Contract Platform that allows for the crowdsourcing of projects VIA a Token Sale that can be configured with different parameters like Staking Requirements, whitelisting requirements, token vesting, milestone-based funding, and more.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** At EOSTARTER, we believe that EOSIO is only as valuable as the products and applications built on top of it, and this is our main focus to incentivize the growth of the ecosystem. Is short: “Succesful EOSIO Projects means Succesful EOSIO”

- **Reason for Interest:** Our team's founder has been involved in EOS since Genesis and has been dedicating most of his energy and focus since to growing the ecosystem and bringing in new projects to build on EOS. We believe a new era for builders and entrepreneurs is coming to EOSIO. If we can build a platform that facilitates new projects to launch and build a community while also promoting the use of EOS and other EOSIO Tokens, then we all win!

### Project Details

The core details for the TokenSale Platform have been laid out in this article we posted for our initial Pomelo grant: https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-tokensale-platform-scope-of-work-4cb153c33ab6

- Mockups/designs of any UI components: 
  The final UI components for the TokenSale platform are yet to be designed.
  
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
  The Data Model can be observed in our current TokenSale Smart Contract MVP: https://github.com/eostarter/eostarter.sale-smart-contract

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
  This project features all the latest technologies and practices in the industry.
- Hapi
- Hasura
- React
- Kubernetes
- EOSIO

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
  The core documentation for the platform requirements can be read here: https://github.com/eostarter/token-sale-platform
  
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
  We have a working DEMO of the SmartContract ready to test on Jungle at: https://tokensale.eosio.cr/
  * Please contact us so that we can verify your Jungle account as either an Investor or a Project Owner (the 2 main users for the platform)

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - We are not building a Decentralized Exchange, there is no DeFi algoithms involved other than the sale of a projects tokens at a detemrined Price
  - Our project will NOT develop an NFT Market Place, but rather leverage existing NFT MarketPlaces like AtomicHub for the NFT Drops

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  EOSTARTER Fits into the category of Ecosystem Growth.
  By promoting EOSIo Projects to new potential investors, we not only motivate entrepreneurs to build on EOS, but we also motivate EOS Holders to take their EOS OFF of exchanges and put them to use and support the growing ecosystem.
  
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  We have 2 major focuses as Target Audiences:
  1 - Early-stage Crypto Investors 
  2 - Entrepreneurs and Developers

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  EOSTARTER provides a solution for projects wanting to get early-stage funding from the community, and it provides a good method for community members and investors to get access to projects very early on.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  There is another launchpad called T-starter built on Telos: https://tstarter.io/
  They are mainly Telos-Focused and there hasn't been large raises on the Launchpad. We believe we can improve both on the experience and on the actual token sales.
  Outside of EOSIO, there are dozens of Launchpads. Lately, every Category in Crypto has a dedicated Launchpad. ALL Major Blockchain Platforms have a go-to Launchpad for the community to get a glimpse of the projects building on that platform. We aim to be the EOS premier Launchpad.
   
## Team

Our team is small but very Strong. It is conmprised of highly experienced engineers, EOS Genesis Holders, and avid community Builders. 
We are also partnering with Edenia (EOS CostaRica) to increase our Development capacity: https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-and-eos-costa-rica-enter-a-strategic-partnership-59b7119ac93c

## Future Plans

We plan to become the premier Launchpad for EOS Projects, this means not only building the platform but constantly improving it, engaging with the community and new projects that wish to launch on EOSTARTER. We want to develop an NFT Project Launchpad and subsequently build a full market-place for project launches and NFTs.

It is no secret that succesful launches require a lot of capital injection and liquidity. We intend to continuosly engage investors both inside and specially outside the EOS community to bring in capital and help us launch new projects and potentially existing projects on other platforms that wish to expand onto EOS.
