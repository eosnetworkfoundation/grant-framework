# EOS Network Foundation Grant Proposal

- **Project Name: EOSTARTER**
- **Team Name: Eostarter Ltd.** 
- **EOS Payment Address: eostartereos** 
- **Level: 3**

## Project Overview

EOSTARTER is a community-powered Incubator for new projects building on EOS. We are building a Gamified Launchpad Platform where investors can participate in early-stage projects and be part of their success. As part of our business model, we launch Token Presales and NFT Drops for teams and companies that build their products on EOSIO.

### Overview

- **Name:** EOSTARTER TokenSale Platform 

- **Brief Description:** We are proposing to develop a Token Sale Smart Contract Platform that allows for the crowdsourcing of projects VIA a Token Sale that can be configured with different parameters like Staking Requirements, whitelisting requirements, token vesting, milestone-based funding, and more.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** At EOSTARTER, we believe that EOSIO is only as valuable as the products and applications built on top of it, and this is our main focus to incentivize the growth of the ecosystem. Is short: “Succesful EOSIO Projects means Succesful EOSIO”

- **Reason for Interest:** Our team's founder has been involved in EOS since Genesis and has been dedicating most of his energy and focus since to growing the ecosystem and bringing in new projects to build on EOS. We believe a new era for builders and entrepreneurs is coming to EOSIO. If we can build a platform that facilitates new projects to launch and build a community while also promoting the use of EOS and other EOSIO Tokens, then we all win!

### Project Details

The core details for the TokenSale Platform have been laid out in this article we posted for our initial Pomelo grant: https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-tokensale-platform-scope-of-work-4cb153c33ab6

- Mockups/designs of any UI components: 
  The final UI components for the TokenSale platform are yet to be designed.
  
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
  The Data Model can be observed in our current TokenSale Smart Contract MVP: https://github.com/eostarter/eostarter.sale-smart-contract

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
  This project features all the latest technologies and practices in the industry.
- Hapi
- Hasura
- React
- Kubernetes
- EOSIO

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
  The core documentation for the platform requirements can be read here: https://github.com/eostarter/token-sale-platform
  
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
  We have a working DEMO of the SmartContract ready to test on Jungle at: https://tokensale.eosio.cr/
  * Please contact us so that we can verify your Jungle account as either an Investor or a Project Owner (the 2 main users for the platform)

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - We are not building a Decentralized Exchange, there is no DeFi algoithms involved other than the sale of a projects tokens at a detemrined Price
  - Our project will NOT develop an NFT Market Place, but rather leverage existing NFT MarketPlaces like AtomicHub for the NFT Drops

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  EOSTARTER Fits into the category of Ecosystem Growth.
  By promoting EOSIo Projects to new potential investors, we not only motivate entrepreneurs to build on EOS, but we also motivate EOS Holders to take their EOS OFF of exchanges and put them to use and support the growing ecosystem.
  
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  We have 2 major focuses as Target Audiences:
  1 - Early-stage Crypto Investors 
  2 - Entrepreneurs and Developers

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  EOSTARTER provides a solution for projects wanting to get early-stage funding from the community, and it provides a good method for community members and investors to get access to projects very early on.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  There is another launchpad called T-starter built on Telos: https://tstarter.io/
  They are mainly Telos-Focused and there hasn't been large raises on the Launchpad. We believe we can improve both on the experience and on the actual token sales.
  Outside of EOSIO, there are dozens of Launchpads. Lately, every Category in Crypto has a dedicated Launchpad. ALL Major Blockchain Platforms have a go-to Launchpad for the community to get a glimpse of the projects building on that platform. We aim to be the EOS premier Launchpad.
   
## Team

Our team is small but very Strong. It is conmprised of highly experienced engineers, EOS Genesis Holders, and avid community Builders. 
We are also partnering with Edenia (EOS CostaRica) to increase our Development capacity: https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-and-eos-costa-rica-enter-a-strategic-partnership-59b7119ac93c

## Development Roadmap

In Terms of the EOSTARTER Project, the Full Roadmap is available here: https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-the-road-ahead-446477d84259
We have been delayed due to budget constraints among other factors, but that outlines the major vision.

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
