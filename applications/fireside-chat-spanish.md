## Project Overview

> If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful ENF grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- **Brief Description:** A brief description of your project.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the EOS Network or Antelope software.
- **Reason for Interest:** An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components
- Data models of the core functionality
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOS Network landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status

> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/tree/main/docs/rfps) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the EOS Network Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Milestone Summary

> Note: the numbers in the three lines below are examples.  Please replace with your own calculations!  Then delete this instruction line.
> You **must** keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved.  The Total Cost should add up to the costs
> of all of your Milestones.  Please **DO NOT** remove the three lines below.  If you do, your grant will be rejected or delayed while you fix it.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 12,000 USD

> Please note that this application is automatically parsed.<br/>
> For the above fields, please only put the answer on that line.  If you want to add more information, please put it below these instructions.<br/>
> Please remember to delete all lines that start with `>` as they are just instructions and not needed in the application submission.<br/>
> 
> Notes on above fields:
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
