## Project Overview

The EOS Fireside Chat in Spanish is the meeting place for the entire Hispanic community!

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** The EOS Fireside Chat in Spanish
- **Brief Description:** The Fireside Chat allows you to organize a series of talks, weekly news and interviews in Spanish, carried out through the Discord platform, with the aim of providing information, education and promoting community participation in the EOS ecosystem.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** The EOS Fireside Chat is an event directly related to the EOS community and ecosystem. It is a space where community members can come together to discuss, learn and share information about EOS. The main objective of the Fireside Chat is to provide a meeting place and promote the active participation of the community in the development and evolution of EOS.
- **Reason for Interest:** This project of talks and interviews on Discord for the EOS community offers access to valuable information, education, active participation, networking opportunities and the possibility of accessing the content later. These reasons can arouse great interest among the members of the EOS community, thus giving us the opportunity to grow as a community and see more projects and development.

### Project Details

-Who is the host? Veronica Diaz
-Any co-host? Nelson Aular.
-Who is recording and broadcasting the event? Posted on which social media platforms/sites?
The event will be recorded via OBS live on Youtube and Twitter.
-Dates of events? Every Thursday at 19:00 UTC
-How often? 2 times a month.
-Game Plan: Access to the official notes of the Fireside Chat, special interviews, invitations to different people, deliveries of Pop Tokens.

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOS Network landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? This Discord chat and interview project fits into the EOS ecosystem by providing a space for community interaction and education. It focuses on providing relevant information, promoting active participation and fostering the growth and development of EOS. By offering thematic talks and interviews with experts, the project contributes to the exchange of knowledge and strengthens the community at large.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? The target audience for this project are members of the Spanish-speaking EOS community and anyone who wishes to join. This can include developers of chains, dApps, wallets, and general users who are interested in learning more about EOS and actively participating in its development. It is also intended to attract designers and anyone interested in the EOS ecosystem.
- What need(s) does your project meet? This project addresses the need for information, education and active participation in the EOS ecosystem in Spanish. It provides an opportunity where community members can access up-to-date information from throughout the week, learn from leading experts and leaders, ask questions, and participate in interactive discussions. In addition, recordings allow content to be accessed later, satisfying the need to access quality information at any time.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem? Although there may be other projects related to the dissemination of information and participation in the EOS ecosystem, not all are the same, it is important to investigate specifically within the EOS network and the Antelope ecosystem to carry out the different talks so that you have a previous experience of the topics. EOS already has two Fireside Chats in English and Chinese.
  - If so, how is your project different? The selection of specific topics for the community in Spanish, the quality of the guests and experts, the format of the talks and interviews, the interaction with the community.

## Development Status

-The project has been created after having different talks and conversations, where the corresponding permissions for its creation were sought.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Milestone Summary

> You **must** keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved.  The Total Cost should add up to the costs
> of all of your Milestones.  Please **DO NOT** remove the three lines below.  If you do, your grant will be rejected or delayed while you fix it.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 12,000 USD

> Notes on above fields:
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
