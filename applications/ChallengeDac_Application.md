## Project Overview


### Overview

- **Name:** CHALLENGEEOS
- **Brief Description:** We provide users with a way to publish and interact with customizable smart contracts through our free-to-download app.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Our project was initially built on the EOSIO Blockchain and we are one of the pioneer EOSIO projects.
- **Reason for Interest:**  Our dapp is a tool used to create awareness and is used to onboard new users on the EOSIO Blockchain.

### Project Details
•  In Milestone 1, We will add needed code to the ChallengeDac code base to reduce fraudulent accounts and provide an increased level of user support for bug issues. Additionally, conduct a full audit of all of the ChallengeDac code so it can be Open-sourced.
•  Improved Identity Solution features to reduce bots and limit users to one account per person. This will improve the results reducing the number of token rewards that are claimed by bots or users operating multiple accounts. Enhanced identity techniques will include IP address tracking, catch verification, and unique user identification.
•  User support features to help identify and track bugs and phone-specific issues and also add troubleshooting
•  ChallengeDac code audit: Fully audit ChallengeDac code complete with new features to release with new features to release publicly to the community.
•  In Milestone 2, Our version 9 will be released with the ‘Go Live’ feature which will consist of a built-in streaming plug-in tool that will allow ChallengeDac users to login to major streaming platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Twitch.   In the lower bottom corner, streaming users will have their ChallengeDAC username displayed, which will allow users to be sent crypto while live streaming. Wherever Crypto is sent during the live stream a notification will appear on the stream. All current live streamers will have their stream displayed on the ChallengeDac News feed and will be available for ChallengeDac users to vote on, with the most voted on streams appearing highest in the ChallengeDac newsfeed. After the completion of ChallengeDac version 9, the code will be audited and open-sourced to the community.
