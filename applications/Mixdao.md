## Project Overview

### Overview

> Please provide the following:
- **Name:** PINK Pink Dream Estate
- **Brief Description:** PINK Pink Dream Manor is a decentralized project platform that provides EOS users and project teams with various services, such as trading, mining, market making, lockdown, wealth management, account registration, CPU purchase, memory purchase, resource free transfer, red envelope sending, NFT trading, and other functions; Among them, SWAP has added a lockdown function compared to other decentralized exchanges, increasing project stability and user loyalty; The pomelo red envelope is an innovative project. For example, sending red envelopes is an important social behavior among Chinese people. Sending red envelopes can effectively improve user activity. The pomelo red envelope is the first red envelope DAPP on pomelo, making efforts to explore the application of EOS and expanding the scope of EOS's smart contracts and NFT applications. It draws on the idea of WeChat red envelopes and implements its functions on the blockchain. Due to the smooth trading status of EOS, the effect of grabbing red envelopes on blockchain is comparable to grabbing red envelopes on WeChat. Our red envelope grabbing technology has wide availability and is currently open source to the community, allowing all DAPPs with red envelope grabbing needs to use this technology for customized red envelope grabbing services.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** A public facility that provides more services for EOS users and project teams, such as registering accounts, purchasing content, making free transfers, sending red envelopes, etc., and providing open source, which will help with the EOSIO code resource library.

- **Reason for Interest:** 
It provides more services for EOS users and project teams to gain more revenue and services. It will bring lock-in volume and revenue to the MIXDAO team, while benefiting participants. Ecosystem improvement: attract inactive EOS tokens, which will prosper the ecosystem.



### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOSIO landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:
- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
> Provide project teams with services such as pomelo red envelopes, market mining, and market lockdown, without the need for repeated development by the project team. Provide EOS users with pomelo red envelopes, market mining, market lockdown, account registration, CPU purchase, memory purchase, and resource free transfer services, allowing EOS users to experience multiple EOS interactive experiences in a one-stop manner.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? 
> EOS users including any dapp user and project teams

- What need(s) does your project meet?
> For generating yield and income when holding EOS

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
> There is no similar project for the pomelo red envelope service in the EOSIO ecosystem, and this project is an innovation; SWAP has similar projects, such as DeFi 
 
- If so, how is your project different?
> DAOSWAP has functions such as market making lockdown and market making red envelopes, which other platforms do not have

## Our Dream 

Dex, as one of the few blockchain application products that can be implemented, is no longer a problem in terms of technology implementation. However, whether it can bring higher efficiency to users, reduce their usage costs, meet their various needs, and whether it has commercial sustainability will determine its future development. To have lasting vitality, a product must not only conform to the trend of the times, but also have cultural connotations. As one of the products in the blockchain field, DEX must have a certain cultural connotation to connect these users in order to survive and grow in the long term. So behind a well-developed DEX in the future, there will definitely be a strong community and community culture. Economic incentives alone cannot last long. Each DEX must condense its own community culture, which may be a vision, a sentiment, or the origin or continuation of a story. Only with such cultural connotations can it survive and become better and better. We are willing to work hard, we are also willing to give, and we are doing the same! In addition, we are also willing to innovate on EOS, such as pomelo red envelopes, etc.

### 我们的梦想

Dex作为目前少数能落地的区块链应用产品，在技术实现上已不成问题，但能否为用户带来更高的效率，能否降低用户的使用成本，满足用户的各方面需求，以及是否有商业上的可持续性将决定其未来的发展。一个产品要想有持久的生命力，除了顺应时代发展的大势外，其本身一定要有文化内涵。DEX作为区块链领域的产品之一，要想长久生存并发展壮大，我想它一定也得有一定的文化内涵将这些用户联系在一起。所以未来发展得好的DEX背后一定会有一个强大的社区以及社区文化，光凭经济利益的激励势必不能长久，每个DEX都要凝聚出自己的社区文化，它可能是一种远景，可能是一种情怀，又或者是一个故事的源起或待续，只有有了这样的文化内涵才能一直存活下去，并越来越好。我们愿意努力，我们也愿意付出，我们也正在这么做！除此之外我们也愿意在EOS做一些创新比如柚子红包。
