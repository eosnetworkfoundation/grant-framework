## Project Overview

We are proposing to advance the mass adoption of EOS by deploying the Livetree decentralised autonomous #Collectives social network to EOS and integrating EOS into the front end iOS/Android [Livetree App](https://www.livetree.com).

Context: Social media is broken. Today’s social networks do not provide the necessary free and open exchange between content creators and users, instead, major social network corporations act as “middleman” dominated by ad revenue, shareholder and billionaire dictates, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms. The consequences of such opaque social networks have left users facing unprecedented levels of privacy violations; content creators unable to realise the full potential value of their creative works; and helped exacerbate global climate, economic and democratic crisis’. The solution is a social network of decentralised autonomous #Collectives - Livetree. The first component is the iOS /Android Livetree App, a fast, highly usable, and familiar user-experience/user-interface, open-source, creator-focused app that provides transparency over income generated from user posts, provides additional blockchain based income streams, while putting users in control of the entire social network and, thereby, their data and privacy. Livetree has developed state-of-the-art advanced live video streaming infrastructure, social graph data schemas and royalty payment systems to a massively scalable production-grade technical capacity to realise the solution - the decentralised social network of the future is now here and will be run on EOS. 

### Overview

- **Name:** Livetree a socially conscious network of decentralised autonomous #Collectives for creators
- **Brief Description:** Livetree provides creators access to untapped Web 3.0 revenue streams and enables them to directly collaborate with their fans through an advanced #Collective (DAO). 
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Livetree will bring mass adoption to EOSIO by deploying and integrating its smart contracts to the Trust EVM (referred to in this document as EOS).
- **Reason for Interest:** We believe EOS provides a number of technical advantages and its community would benefit from a decentralised social network.

### Project Details

We have been working in video streaming, royalties and crowdfunding since 2016. Bringing this all together we launched the Livetree iOS/Android social network app which extends social profiles to automatically create and associate a decentralised autonomous #Collective (which one can think of as an extended DAO). The highly scalable video infrastructure, A.I. process and decentralised components have been built and are available via iOS and Android appstores. 

A #Collective technically defines an interface for a resolver naming service smart contract (representing the unique #hashtag name of the collective) which is used to audit income generated from posts. Posts generate royalties via pay-per-view videos, live video event tickets, tips and rewards. The royalties are transparently audited and stored via EOS in the #Collective’s Treasury smart contract. NFTs assets can be added to the #Collective again on EOS. Video, image, text posts can be easily converted to NFTs through the app and added to the #Collective. The NFT and Treasury is fractionalised into ERC20 (1 million) #Collective membership tokens minted on EOS. The membership tokens implement IERC20Votable and provide governance over the #Collective’s Treasury, creative licenses agreements and several other proposal types. This enables a new form of collaboration and advances typical social network followers or fans to members. Members can redeem their proportional (against the total 1 million minted) ownership of the membership coins against the Treasury and also make proposals, vote while also providing discounts and exclusive access to events to members. We have fully implemented the #Collective and integrated it seamlessly into the Livetree iOS/Android App (the app itself is as easy to use as TikTok) which is backed by a significant scalable infrastructure, accounting royalty system, that also supports AI video machine learning, video streaming and recommendation systems – the technical infrastructure has taken over 5+ years to develop.

#Collectives are extremely powerful, for example, think of #PlasticFreeOceans, whereabouts income generated from **any** post tagged with #PlasticFreeOceans is audited and deposited on blockchain for the collective called #PlasticFreeOceans. This grant enables us to deploy, test and offer #Collective functionality via EOS and to the EOS community via the Livetree iOS/Android apps and dApp Livetree creator [portal](https://portal.livetree.com).  We have proposed a new [EIP-6145](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6145) standard to back the social network. 

### Ecosystem Fit

The principal goal of this grant is to facilitate EOS ecosystem growth. EOS has a number of significant advantages and the values of the community and ethos behind EOS closely align with the non-profit, open-source goals of Livetree. Livetree could significantly advance the mass adoption of EOS by incorporating support for the Trust EVM. Furthermore, we believe the long term future development of governance over A.I. would be well suited to the EOS chain. We are not aware of any project in the EOS ecosystem that would be able to facilitate main-stream adoption through an easy to use highly sophisticated decentralised social network such as Livetree and the associated dApp creator [portal](https://portal.livetree.com).

We will also be adding support to EOS for the [EIP-6145](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6145) proposed royalty treasury standard which enables any social network or website like Reddit to deposit royalties tagged with  crypto-naming-service registered hashtags.

## Development Status

The app and backend services have taken a number of years to develop. We have deployed the app to the iOS App Store and Google Play Store. The portal dApp has been built and is at a production level.

## Future Plans

Livetree's current machine learning capabilities include for image/video: Speech-to-text, object recognition (e.g. bicycles, tables), facial recognition (e.g. gender, age, race), geo-location, landmark recognition (e.g. Eiffel Tower), OCR (e.g. written text in videos) and sentiment (e.g. happy). The key innovation to date has been a system to democratically govern recommendation algorithms, 
censorship and keyword metadata using simple blockchain governor, we would like to extend this functionality to govern the machine learning at a much more fundamental level. This will require a very high throughput and  free transaction manaagement.  We believe EOS main chain could the solution we have been looking for, the machine learning pallete would also be a signficant technical advanatage for EOS.



## Additional Information
This grant application comes after several meetings and demonstrations of the Livetree app to several of the EOS team. We have had extensive demos with [Michael Tan](https://zaisan.io/about/), [Daniel Liven](https://zaisan.io/about/) and [Sebastiaan Opschoor](https://zaisan.io/about/) whom we believe would support this application and have encouraged us to join and deploy the Livetree app on the EOSIO network. Livetree has been monitoring the developments of EOSIO from early 2017. From Block.one to the community take back more recently. We believe there is close alignment in values and overall objectives of decentralisation.
