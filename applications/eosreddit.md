## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** EOS VISION x REDDIT AND FACEBOOK
- **Brief Description:** Welcome to EOS REDDIT 2.0, the new stage of EOS REDDIT, where we will be able to turn the old, lonely and depressed Reddit into a new way of reading the news and giving constructive opinions. Our trained team prepares to work on 3 Fundamental Pillars, offering a new face to Reddit, as well as providing new alternatives and attention to users with a misconception of EOS. Let's get ready to interact in all of Reddit in a respectful way, not only in the official EOS Reddit, trying to give a good marketing to what is being developed in EOS, reaching other Subreddits informing in a simple way developments, processes, improvements and projects that we have within the ecosystem.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We prepare to promote the EOS and EOSIO community in the best possible way, with good marketing, as well as to demonstrate that the work that is done together between the blockchains has borne fruit and momentum to EOSIO. Reddit has an extensive number of users who will not hesitate to look at the information related to EOS AND EOSIO.
- **Reason for Interest:** EOS VISION proposes to support the EOS community on Reddit, which has 97.7k members, is being one of the largest EOS communities, it is also the one with the most FUD of all EOS, since a couple of years, It has been a bit abandoned, and has been recovering thanks to the team of EOS SUPPORT and EOS BEES. We have seen how necessary and important this social network can be to attract both new users and new projects, so we propose to support Reddit.

### Project Details

- Our Mission
Educate and inform the crypto currency world about the most recent events about EOS and its technological improvements, generate active use of Reddit encouraging the adoption of EOS, promoting the different contents of interest to users on Reddit. 
- Projects Secondary Objectives:
Weekly informative bulletins and important information releases.
Important podcasts with the EOS community.
General support for the different EOS projects.
Informative courses for new users in EOS.
Monthly report of the work done in EOS VISION.
- Oriented to solve current problems
Interact and correct misconceptions about EOS on social networks, especially on twitter and Reddit, which have been based on price, as well as respectfully encourage users who make negative comments dedicated to FUD to check the new stage of EOS.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
We intend to use the reports, news, videos and other RELEVANT information found in the EOS COMMUNITY, and thus broadcast it on the social networks of Reddit and Facebook.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
We will support Reddit, but it will not be owned by us, EOS REDDIT and EOS Facebook is owned by the community and anyone can provide their services.
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
  - 3 PILLARS VISIONS REDDIT.
1.Make different daily Posts regarding the EOS Ecosystem: Maintaining activity within Reddit is one of the most important ways to eradicate FUD, demonstrating that it is an active community and that good opportunities, good projects are being created and there are new news for read, share and comment at all times.

2. Increase in daily moderation: A moderation of all the SPAM that contains the official EOS reddit will be carried out, as well as the active moderation queue that may exist, it is worth mentioning that the SPAM queue has accumulated in recent months due to the number of bots that enter our Reddit.

3. Reddit-Discord Reward System: Based on the “Tip.cc” Reward system in Discord, and the EOS BEES idea of ​​performing “SWARM PAID” to different important Twitter Posts, we will bring this idea to Reddit, dedicate 2 minutes a day to Vote on our Reddit, check out the “VISIONS REDDIT” channel where we will upload active posts daily, here you can vote and post in our thread that you have voted so that you can earn daily rewards.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Our project is in Ecosystem Growth, we hope to give good support to both EOS and projects, on Reddit and Facebook.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our hearing is based on:
Journalists
crypto users.
New users on EOS and EOSIO.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
A new opportunity for reddit and facebook and using these networks that have many users are given the opportunity to learn more about EOS, its dApps, ecosystem and development in these social networks and show what is being created.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  Yes, currently some of the users within EOS post on Reddit, but not daily, EOS NATION and EOS SUPPORT post important details whenever needed. The difference of our proposal is that we intend to have Reddit active daily, with any relevant information.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
