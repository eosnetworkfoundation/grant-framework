## Project Overview

We are going to create educational and compelling videos introducing EOS, the ENF and the Antelope chain to the masses in order to cultivate and grow decentralized communities. Doing that, we will attract the attention of talented creators and builders to the EOS ecosystem by creating engaging content as well as increasing shareability.

### Overview

**Name:** Videos For EOS
**Brief Description:** Creating video content for EOS social media, launching fun and educational videos around the EOS ecosystem. We believe that incorporating social media videos and educational content into a brand's marketing strategy can have a positive impact on engagement, reach, conversions, and overall brand perception.
**Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** I’m the co-lead of FIO Latin America, FIO is a sister chain of EOS. My teammate is a long term EOS fan participating in some EOS projects since 2018.
**Reason for Interest:** We firmly believe that the ENF will finally bring the promise of the early EOS days to reality, the operating system upon which all sorts of exciting Dapps would be built. It is still the most performant blockchain and we are certain that many more projects will be built on Antelope/EOS. With Web3 getting more and more popular, we have before us a golden opportunity to bring users, attention and projects into the EOS/Antelope ecosystem through engaging social media content and fun/educational videos to introduce EOS to the larger public. Especially nowadays since video is the most important form of communication.

### Project Details


We will be launching a series of educational videos in a compelling manner to introduce the public to the EOS ecosystem, the Antelope chain, the EVM as well as some of the popular platforms built on EOS and of course the ENF. We will also have interviews and other surprises. 

All and all, it’s a series of 40 videos, 3 videos per week in order to build a steadfast audience and drive engagement.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

The EOS ecosystem is rich in amazing platforms and projects, from Metaverse games to NFT collections and everything in between. But all that quality is not reflected as much when it comes to content. The audience at large does not have amazing content that tell the EOS story, or shows them why Antelope/EOS is important.. Especially not in the format that most audiences respond to today which is Video which is an invaluable tool to increase brand awareness and build a bigger community.

- **Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**
The blockchain public at large, from Dapp Builders to Web3 enthusiasts. Our goal is to grow the EOS audience bigger.


- **What need(s) does your project meet?**

Providing value to the users through educational videos, as well as increasing exposure, and brand awareness, spur user engagement and attracting a new audience.

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?**

Not that we know of.

**If so, how is your project different?**

**If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**

The Exodus Wallet channel and Unstoppable Domains are a great example how educational and fun content can grow the community and engagement.
