# ENF Grant Badge Usage Guidelines
Usage of the ENF Grant Badge must adhere to the following guidelines.

**Once a project's first milestone has been accepted**, we intend to help teams acknowledge their grant publicly while observing the ENF’s guidelines.

To that end, we’ve created a badge for grant recipients. This is available for download under [eosnetworkfoundation/grants/badge](../img/ENF-grant-badge.svg).

*Before you begin using the badge, please note the following points:*

- Use of the Grant Framework badge is reserved for [Level 2 and 3 grants](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/README.md#grant-levels).
- Grants are awarded **for specific projects**, not to teams in general as a blanket endorsement.
- The ENF and its grants program **don’t broker partnerships or joint ventures**, or cosign wholesale any external team’s work. Bearing that in mind, **the badge should only be displayed in project-specific contexts.**
- Please **do**: display the badge
  - in a GitHub repository that contains code connected with the grant project,
  - on any project-specific webpage **that specifically concerns the deliverables completed as part of the grant**, or
  - when appropriate, in a tweet or blog post announcing your grant in a project-specific context.
- Please **don’t**:
  - display the badge on your team or project's landing page,
  - use the badge before your first milestone has been accepted,
  - add it to any social media profiles, or
  - use it in any other context that could misrepresent your relationship with the Web3 Foundation.


Also, please don't use the **name or logo of the EOS Network Foundation** in any context that could misrepresent your relationship with the EOS Network Foundation. Infringement of these guidelines can result in an immediate annulment of the grant.

In case of any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at grants@eosn.foundation.
