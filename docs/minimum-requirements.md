# Grant Project Minimum Requirements
- All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. 
-- We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.
- We require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works.
- At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding.
